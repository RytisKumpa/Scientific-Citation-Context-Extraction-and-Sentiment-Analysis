n	Adversarial examples for deep neural networks were first introduced in <TARGET_CIT> , while some recent works propose to utilize them as a regularization technique for training deep models <TARGET_CIT> . However , all of those works attempt to find the " worst case " examples in a local neighborhood of the original training data and are not focused on measuring the global robustness of an algorithm nor on studying the connection between robustness and generalization .

o	In fact , as discussed in Chancellor / <TARGET_CIT> our construction here can be easily generalized to any Hamiltonian with this symmetry .
n	In principle , stereo methods using PatchMatch inference <TARGET_CIT> can not take advantage of the cost filtering acceleration , since in those methods the candidate disparity labels are given dynamically to each pixel and we can not make a consistent - label cost - volume slice <MATH> .

o	This is in line with the strategy of <TARGET_CIT> , and is in contrast to large deviation methods used in some of the work referenced in Section sec : intro_history , where the nature of these earlier problems requires working within events of small probability .
o	It is worth noticing that there is a body of literature that considers envy - free pricing as a purely optimization problem ( with no regard to incentives ) and provides approximation algorithms and hardness results for maximizing revenue and welfare in different auction settings <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Of course , there are plenty of applications of say representation theory to the theory of projective structures ( see e.g. <TARGET_CIT> ) , but not in the other directions .

Second , although such null model predictor has been tested previously on uniformly random trees <TARGET_CIT> , one can not assume the predictor will work on real sentences given the substantial statistical differences between uniformly random trees and real syntactic dependency trees <TARGET_CIT> .

o	Note that the range of <MATH> in <TARGET_CIT> is erroneously claimed to be <MATH> as opposed to <MATH> .
p	In <TARGET_CIT> , they further randomize the construction above , by using results from locally sensitive hashing , to obtain a feature map which is a binary code . It can be shown that their methods satisfy Assumption for an appropriate choice of <MATH> and the probability distribution <MATH> .
o	An alternative consists in a conservative cell - centered discretization , which was first introduced by Godunov in <TARGET_CIT> .
n	Problem prob:1_1 includes convex stochastic optimization problems in classifier ensemble <TARGET_CIT> . However , the existing approaches in hayashi are based on deterministic convex optimization and have not yet led to a complete solution of the classifier ensemble problem .
p	Such estimates for the case of real <MATH> are commonplace as intermediate steps towards concentration inequalities , such as in the classical works of Hoeffding and McDiarmid <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Introduction Deep Neural Networks ( DNNs ) have been successfully applied in many artificial intelligence tasks , providing state - of - the - art performance and a remarkably small generalization error . On the other hand , DNNs often have far more trainable model parameters than the number of samples they are trained on and were shown to have a large enough capacity to memorize the training data <TARGET_CIT> .
o	We follow the methods of <TARGET_CIT> , which rely on the Holder regularity in <MATH> of the subsolutions of the associated ergodic problem and on a Strong Maximum Principle .
o	Indeed , analysis of pisr for non - degenerate equilibrium systems for <MATH> and <MATH> , recovers their important well - known result ( see Appendix B ) <TARGET_CIT> <MATH> .
o	There is a <MATH> -equivariant Hecke operator <MATH> acting on <MATH> , defined in <TARGET_CIT> ( see Paragraph descrT for an explicit description of this operator )
o	It turns out that the Hamming weights of all codewords are divisible by <MATH> , see <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Since the HGF in eq : Bekenstein is precisely the same as the one in eq : example2a , the form eq : example2b can be directly applied to get the algebraic asymptotic form of the main result of <TARGET_CIT> for a macroscopic black hole .
o	A brief , self - contained presentation of these concepts is given in <TARGET_CIT> .

p	On the other hand , the clustering parameter space is challenging to adequately explore . Instead , sophisticated local proposals are required . <TARGET_CIT> implement a clustering proposal which cumulatively adds observation branches ( as shown in Figure ) to clusters by starting with empty clusters with mean and variance equal to their corresponding prior means . As each observation branch is added to one of the clusters ( in random order ) , the means and variances of that cluster are updated according to the corresponding posterior means . This allows the sampler to propose clusters for each branch according to the cluster in which it fits best , while randomising the order of the allocation meant that no branches were given higher weight than others .

o	For PMF , the number of superpixels <MATH> is set to <MATH> , <MATH> , and <MATH> as used in Lu13 ( <MATH> is the default in <TARGET_CIT> ) , and we sufficiently iterate 30 times .
o	Also it is not clear for us how to define the equivariant integration in <TARGET_CIT> rigorously .
o	The orientation data <MATH> and the triangle property of the motives of the quadratic forms <MATH> were introduced by Kontsevich - Soibelman in <TARGET_CIT> in the more general setting of the motivic Donaldson - Thomas invariants .
o	It is possible to replace the output of APPR with the solution of l1pg and still maintain the combinatorial guarantees for PageRank - Nibble as in <TARGET_CIT> ; see also the discussion in Section .
o	To show this , we will apply induction as in <TARGET_CIT> .
o	The techniques involved here are similar to those used , in the case of minimal surfaces in three - dimensional hyperbolic geometry , in <TARGET_CIT> .

o	This problem has been studied in political science , economics , operations research , and computer science for over 200 years <TARGET_CIT> .

o	Observe that <MATH> , for every fixed <MATH> , is a bounded martingale sequence adapted to the information at Player 2 , and as a result as <MATH> , by the submartingale convergence theorem <TARGET_CIT> there exists <MATH> such that <MATH> almost surely .
o	The flow <MATH> generated by the vector field <MATH> is strong kinematic expansive ( cf . <TARGET_CIT> ) ( see Figure 1 below )

o	The second step establishes that the surrogate costs <MATH> form a quasi - martingale sequence <TARGET_CIT> , and using tightness of the surrogate cost we deduce that <MATH> .
o	So all requirements from basicassumption are met : we have a finitary endofunctor <MATH> on the lfp category <MATH> , and by <TARGET_CIT> <MATH> preserves monos since <MATH> does .
o	This singularity also has <MATH> , so , by the general discussion of <MATH> deformations of superconformal field theories given in <TARGET_CIT> , these theories will have a corresponding exactly marginal deformation parameter , <MATH> .
o	Moreover , we want to emphasize that the map <MATH> , which is naturally a <MATH> -fold ramified cover ( whose Galois group is the group of <MATH> -torsion points of <MATH> , see <TARGET_CIT> ) , is actually etale near <MATH> .
o	It was found in the case of <MATH> gravity a dynamic symmetry breaking field could transition between Lorentzian and Euclidean phases in simple cosmological models <TARGET_CIT> .

o	The mapping which sends every function in <MATH> to the function it becomes in the action on the classes of <MATH> is a uniformly continuous clone homomorphism Topo - <TARGET_CIT> , and hence the original action of <MATH> has a uniformly continuous projective clone homomorphism as well .
o	Some of the other recent face detection methods include NPDFaces <TARGET_CIT> , PEP - Adapt <TARGET_CIT> , and <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Then <MATH> defines a partial action of <MATH> on <MATH> <TARGET_CIT> .

o	One generally expects such TQFTs to be described by <MATH> -categories with additional structure <TARGET_CIT> , but the details have not been worked out for <MATH> .
p	The Conjugate Gradient ( CG ) method , which dates back to the 1952 paper by Hestenes and Stiefel <TARGET_CIT> , can be considered as the first of these methods . Although over 60 years old , the CG method is still the work horse method for the solution of linear systems with symmetric positive definite ( SPD ) matrices due to its numerical simplicity and easy implementation .

n	There are many approximations of the complex error function have been reported in the scientific literature <TARGET_CIT> . However , approximations based on rational functions may be more advantageous to gain computational efficiency due to no requirement for nested loop involving decelerating exponential or trigonometric functions dependent upon input the parameters <MATH> and <MATH> . Although the rational approximations of the complex error function are rapid and provide high - accuracy over the most area of the complex plain , all of them have the same drawback ; their accuracy deteriorates with decreasing parameter <MATH> ( in fact , the computation of the complex error function at small <MATH> is commonly considered problematic for high - accuracy computation of the Voigt / complex error function not only in the rational approximations Armstrong1967 )
o	We provide some intuition on the meaning of the above assumptions , and defer the interested reader to <TARGET_CIT> for more details .

o	In one such bijection ( shown in Figure and first given in this non - recursive form by Krattenthaler krattenthaler : permutations- <TARGET_CIT> ) we obtain Dyck paths from permutations of both types by drawing a path above their left - to - right maxima ( an entry is a left - to - right maximum if it is greater than every entry to its left )
o	This was first achieved by McKay and Wormald in 1990 , for allgraphs in the case of degree sequences not far from regular <TARGET_CIT> and some classes of digraphs that include regular tournaments <TARGET_CIT> .

o	To give the reader a feeling for the possibilities , we will do one case in detail , but in the interest of keeping the publication concise , the remaining cases may be found in <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Also , in this case <MATH> is at least a cadlag function , see <TARGET_CIT> or in more generality the differentiated version of eq : Vigon below .
o	Since <TARGET_CIT> and <TARGET_CIT> contain examples of Leavitt path algebras of finite graphs from the class which we consider ( and a related class called polycephaly graphs ) , we concentrate on graphs with infinitely many vertices .
o	We can then directly apply Theorem 1 in <TARGET_CIT> to complete the proof .

o	The closure <MATH> of any permutation group <MATH> in the set of all unary functions on <MATH> is a closed transformation monoid , i.e. , a topologically closed monoid of unary functions , and hence the monoid of endomorphisms of a reduct of <MATH> ( cf . for example <TARGET_CIT> )
o	Faltings <TARGET_CIT> shows that the pullback <MATH> descends naturally to <MATH> , i.e. there exists a ( canonically defined ) line bundle <MATH> on <MATH> with an isomorphism <MATH> .
o	Note that from <TARGET_CIT> we have a continuous linear map : <MATH> compatible with the previous injections .
o	Taking <MATH> , the assertion follows by the definition , see <TARGET_CIT> .
o	In contrast to the local case <MATH> , the decay of eigenfunctions of Schrodinger operators with potentials tending to zero at infinity is only algebraic ; see <TARGET_CIT> .
o	This growth assumption as well as the local inequality are very natural , i.e. , if the Ricci curvature <MATH> of a smooth <MATH> satisfies <MATH> for some <MATH> , then by the Bishop - Gromov comparison theorem ( c.f . Chapter 9 in <TARGET_CIT> ) , Def : Eloc and Def : Ploc are both satisfied .
o	The final claim in the corollary follows immediately from the Martingale Convergence Theorem <TARGET_CIT> .
o	In order to exploit the sparsity of geodesics , a traversal algorithm is used to evaluate betweenness , due to Brandes <TARGET_CIT> .

o	Finally , as is well - known , the space of local types <MATH> of a stable formula over a countable structure is a countable compact zero - dimensional space of finite Cantor - Bendixson rank ( see , for instance , <TARGET_CIT> , Remark 2.3 and Lemma 3.1 )
o	One contribution of this paper is to enable consideration of ( nonsmooth ) convex stochastic optimization over fixed point sets of nonexpansive mappings , in contrast to recent papers <TARGET_CIT> that discussed deterministic convex optimization over the fixed point sets of nonexpansive mappings .

p	Partial group actions began to draw the attention of algebraists after the release of the seminal paper <TARGET_CIT> , by R. Exel and M. Dokuchaev .
o	<MATH> . this is well known from the theory of partial entwining structures <TARGET_CIT> .
o	In contrast to <TARGET_CIT> , where due to the nature of randomization the number of required features for providing an accurate kernel function approximation is often large , systematically learning the ambient nonlinear subspace yields an accurate approximation through a smaller number of extracted features .
o	In particular , the latter are often chosen in such a way that the controller 's decision to invest / disinvest reflects the minimal decomposition of the control process ( cf . <TARGET_CIT> , <TARGET_CIT> and <TARGET_CIT> , among others )
o	In fact , the Gupta - Kumar conjecture Gupta99 on the connectivity of <MATH> where <MATH> represents an Erdos - Renyi ( ER ) graph , took many years ( and several attempts ) to be resolved eventually by Penrose <TARGET_CIT> ; see Yagan / <TARGET_CIT> for a detailed discussion on the difficulties involved in analyzing intersection of different types of graphs .
o	Recently , the first two named authors proved that every conformal minimal immersion <MATH> is isotopic to the real part of a holomorphic null curve <MATH> ( see <TARGET_CIT> )
o	However , due to the very large , if not infinite , state space ( the set of possible posterior distributions over <MATH> ) , the computation is often intractable . In a slightly different setting , Gittins proved in 1979 <TARGET_CIT> that the apparently intractable optimal policy reduces to an index policy , with corresponding indices later called the Gittins indices .
o	Note also that the topic discussed in <TARGET_CIT> is quite general since the linear holonomies of the flat surfaces considered in it , if unitary , are not just <MATH> .
o	The formal solution to opjPDF is(We recall that <MATH> is the Frobenious - Perron operator associated with the quadratic dynamical system ODE1 ( see <TARGET_CIT> )
o	Another variant of this scheme has been used recently in <TARGET_CIT> to generate secret keys of optimal asymptotic length upto the second - order term .
o	In particular , <TARGET_CIT> show that in the case with <MATH> vortices with equal circulations <MATH> in a smooth , bounded , connected , and open domain in <MATH> , the integral version of the partition function eq : partition_function is well defined if and only if <MATH> , where <MATH> is the total circulation of the system .
o	Standard embeddings First we recall some useful notation and facts , following <TARGET_CIT> .
o	There have been several works in recent database literature investigating distributed computation of graph problems in particular , connected components , subgraph enumeration , and PageRank in a message passing framework , e.g. , see <TARGET_CIT> and references therein .
o	Numerical calculation of these network centrality indices can assist certain delay tolerant networking protocols by encouraging mobile vertices to relay data toward exceptionally central mobile vertices whenever possible <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Many MOEAs and other MOMHs use an external archive of potentially non - dominated points , i.e. a Pareto archive containing points not dominated by any other points generated so far , see e.g. <TARGET_CIT> .
o	The energy contained within this ridge is determined by a balance between bending and stretching effects but , crucially , vanishes as the thickness , <MATH> , of the shell vanishes <TARGET_CIT> ( in fact , the energy <MATH> as <MATH> <TARGET_CIT> )
o	Also , after the publication of an earlier version of this paper in arXiv <TARGET_CIT> , a subsequent work by Izumi and Le Gall <TARGET_CIT> , using our information - theoretic approach , shows a lower bound for triangle enumeration in the standard CONGEST distributed computing model ( where the input graph is also the communication graph ) . Indeed , our lower bound result on <MATH> -machine model directly implies a lower bound for the CONGEST model.(In our arXiv version , our lower bound was weaker by a logarithmic factor ; this has been improved in the current version .
o	Most of the work on strategyproof peer selection focuses on the setting in which agents simply approve ( nominate ) a subset of agents <TARGET_CIT> , with the latter three of these restricting attention to the setting in which exactly one agent is selected ( <MATH> )
o	It was conjectured in <TARGET_CIT> that the two - dimensional Wulff crystal tends to a Euclidean ball as <MATH> ; this is still widely open .
o	We use a reduced space Newton - Krylov method <TARGET_CIT> .
o	<MATH> ( <MATH> ): energy of preexisting defects in volume <MATH> of a crystalline parent phase tcolorbox CNT is most widely used to interpret experimental and simulation data <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Minimizing communication is also a key motivation in MapReduce algorithms ( e.g. , see <TARGET_CIT> ) ; however this is generally achieved by making sure that the data is made small enough quickly ( in a small number of MapReduce rounds ) to fit into the memory of a single machine.(We note that in the <MATH> -machine model , the memory usage is also implicitly captured .
p	From the classical <TARGET_CIT> we already used , this gives exactly our formula for <MATH> .
o	On the other hand , conformal minimal surfaces with vertical flux admit the Lopez - Ros deformation ( see <TARGET_CIT> ) which homothetically deforms the complex Gauss map while preserving the third component .
o	These coupled algebraic equations become Fredholm integral equations of the second kind , first derived by Gaudin <TARGET_CIT> .
o	This theorem is due to Kwasnicki <TARGET_CIT> and generalizes an earlier result <TARGET_CIT> for <MATH> .
o	Although the abelian category <MATH> does not necessarily have enough projectives nor enough injectives , we can always define the extension spaces using equivalence classes of extensions in the sense of Yoneda <TARGET_CIT> .
o	For details on <MATH> , we refer to <TARGET_CIT> , <TARGET_CIT> , <TARGET_CIT> and <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Recall that a right graded <MATH> -module is called a Koszul module <TARGET_CIT> if <MATH> has a linear graded projective resolution : <MATH> P^-nP^-1P^0M0 , <MATH> where <MATH> are graded projective modules generated in degree <MATH> for all <MATH> .
o	In <TARGET_CIT> , the author deduce from Proposition B that the continued fraction expansion of an algebraic real number of degree at least <MATH> can not be generated by a finite automaton .
o	For details , see <TARGET_CIT> or <TARGET_CIT> .
o	In particular , when the seed diameter is appropriate ( several times that of the colloidal spheres ) , crystallites nucleate on the seed surface before detaching <TARGET_CIT> ( FIG . 5d )
o	Veech ( and previously Thurston in <TARGET_CIT> for flat surfaces of genus <MATH> ) proves that the preceding map is a local biholomorphism ( see <TARGET_CIT> )
o	Non degeneracy of the limit laws are proved in <TARGET_CIT> and <TARGET_CIT> .
o	For this point , one usually imposes a condition on strategies stronger than totality , e.g. , winning <TARGET_CIT> , that is preserved under composition .
o	In the same article <TARGET_CIT> , the author proves that , in general , the Chow group of a relative cellular space is isomorphic to the Chow group of its base ( <TARGET_CIT> ) and he describes in <TARGET_CIT> how this isomorphism restricts to the irreducible components of the relative cellular space .
o	As recalled in <TARGET_CIT> , CBs of <MATH> SCFTs correspond to scale invariant geometries with one singular point which can always be chosen to be located at the origin .
o	This is implemented as nodddeqn . <TARGET_CIT> ] <MATH> for <MATH> .
o	The remnant 's overall UV spectrum shows absorption over <MATH> - <MATH> consistent with the expectation of absorption dominated by Fe1 and Fe2 but at a level some 2 to 3 times weaker than previously predicted <TARGET_CIT> .
o	For the special case of scaled standard simplices the theorem was shown earlier by Ghasemi and Marshall Ghasemi : Marshall : <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Namely , only <MATH> can report " can do ' <MATH> ' " and then do <MATH> ( as depicted in <TARGET_CIT> )
o	By Theorem 2.18 of <TARGET_CIT> , it follows that <MATH> and <MATH> as well .
o	Let <MATH> be the compensator of <MATH> , which exists by part ( ii ) of Assumption ass : rnd_meas together with <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Our proof uses Elliott - Bratteli intertwining method analogously to how it is used in the proof of Elliott 's Theorem for AF <MATH> -algebras ( see <TARGET_CIT> for example )
o	Though complicated in appearance , this scattering matrix was a key ingredient in their study of generalized theta series , and also in the later development of a metaplectic Casselman - Shalika formula by Chinta and Offen <TARGET_CIT> and McNamara <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Introduction The complex error function also widely known as the Faddeeva function can be defined as <TARGET_CIT> <MATH> .
o	Consequently , combining with Lemma 9.1(ii ) and Rost Nilpotence Corollary 9.3 , one get that there exists a family <MATH> of pairwise orthogonal projectors in <MATH> , satisfying <MATH> , all isomorphic to <MATH> ( with respect to the correspondences <MATH> ) , and such that <MATH> ( see J - <TARGET_CIT> )
n	The issue of exponentially many sets of redundant variables is dealt with in HY2017 in more detail . rem In DBLP : conf / icalp <TARGET_CIT> there was also a note saying that the nBPA - bbis problem can be shown by a slight modification of Mayr 's proof for weak bisimilarity DBLP : journals / tcs / <TARGET_CIT> . Though this note was repeated in further works , no rigorous proof was given ( as pointed out in the first version of this paper DBLP : journals / corr / Jancar16 )
o	Here we develop the study Mukai - <TARGET_CIT> on the polar <MATH> -maps further .
o	As mentioned in <TARGET_CIT> , Feigin in an unpublished work also has a construction of quantum groups in terms of symmetric polynomial ring .
o	For each quiver <MATH> , and each 1-dimensional affine algebraic group <MATH> , we recall the definition of the shuffle algebra associated to <MATH> and <MATH> defined in <TARGET_CIT> , denoted by <MATH> , or simply <MATH> if both <MATH> and <MATH> are clear from the context .
o	Tachyon potentials , which are not steep compared to <MATH> lead to an accelerated expansion <TARGET_CIT> .
o	However , this may be an effect of the shorter sentences observed in these languages ( Tables 5 and 6 of <TARGET_CIT> ) and the tendency of the errors of the predictor to be smaller in sufficiently short sentences ( Figure relative2_figure )
o	Here we follow the analysis of <TARGET_CIT> to calculate the effective annihilation cross section in such a case .
o	Yet another common imputation method is k - Nearest Neighbour Imputation ( kNNI ) <TARGET_CIT> , where the missing features of a data instance are filled in by the means of corresponding features over its k - Nearest Neighbours ( kNN ) , on the observed subspace .
o	Rem It is expected that for any automorphic representation <MATH> , the set <MATH> is a singleton ( see <TARGET_CIT> Conjecture 5.4 )
o	Note that approximate CE is usually defined based on this unconditional version of the CE conditions <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Later , Shioda and Inose shioda - <TARGET_CIT> proved the surjectivity of the period map for singular K3 surfaces by means of Shioda - Inose structures ( as Morrison called them in <TARGET_CIT> ) : if <MATH> is an abelian surface , a Shioda - Inose structure associated to <MATH> a K3 surface <MATH> , which is a 2:1 cover of <MATH> and has the property that <MATH> .
o	This enabled the construction of an infinity of non - isomorphic finite dimensional partial modules over the Sweedler Hopf algebra <TARGET_CIT> .
o	By using an idea of Safarevic <TARGET_CIT> , we reduce the problem of studying the field of moduli of a singular K3 surface <MATH> to the study of the analogous field of a singular abelian surface <MATH> with transcendental lattice <MATH> ( this condition can always be achieved by means of Shioda - Inose structure )
o	Such a feature is generic to all models of Hawking radiation in which the modes originate near the horizon.(It is worth noting here that whilst , the non - standard derivation of <TARGET_CIT> does appear to allow one to avoid this feature , that of <TARGET_CIT> , prima facie , does not[pp .
n	McKague proposed a self - testing procedure for such a graph state in <TARGET_CIT> along with measurements in the <MATH> - <MATH> plane . However , this method requires many copies of the <MATH> -qubit graph state scaling as <MATH> and therefore is not possible with current or near - future quantum technologies .
o	Furthermore , by <TARGET_CIT> the coarse moduli space <MATH> associated to the stack <MATH> is a normal , irreducible , projective variety with at most finite quotient singularities of dimension <MATH> ( M_0,n(X ,
o	In particular , setting <MATH> and <MATH> ( the normal distribution function ) we get the usual Bradley Terry model and the Thurstone model ( see <TARGET_CIT> ) respectively .
o	This requires requires a careful definition of the integration measure ( <TARGET_CIT> , 2.2.4 )
o	For a smooth map <MATH> , the elements <MATH> and <MATH> are <MATH> -related <TARGET_CIT> , denoted <MATH> , if <MATH> .
o	In order to fit our model with the observed <MATH> keV X - Ray line data Xray1 , we follow the constraint on the decay width of the heavier dark matter candidate <MATH> as obtained <TARGET_CIT> <MATH> .
o	The general result follows , by combining these observations with Theorem 3.1 of <TARGET_CIT> where it is shown that <MATH> -repulsive and <MATH> -finite are equivalent .
o	This is necessitated by certain expansivity considerations ; see boyd : <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Recall that Yangian for a finite dimensional Lie algebra is the quantization of a Manin triple <TARGET_CIT> .
o	See <TARGET_CIT> , Theoreme 6 , and <TARGET_CIT> , Theorem 5.1 .
n	Since computing multivariate normal CDFs , which are often implemented with numerical integration or Monte Carlo sampling <TARGET_CIT> , is expensive to evaluate even for moderate <MATH> , calculating this analytically formula quickly becomes slow and numerically challenging as <MATH> grows .
o	Section Application : Poisson : homo serves as the proof of the Poisson algebra homomorphism from the motivic Hall algebra to the motivic quantum torus , where in sec : motivic : Hall we introduce the motivic Hall algebra <MATH> for the abelian category <MATH> ; in sec : algebraic : d : critical : locus we briefly review the notion of algebraic <MATH> -critical locus of Joyce in <TARGET_CIT> ; in motivic : integration : map we define the integration map ;

o	We briefly summarize the main results on <MATH> as derived in <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Compare <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Besides its mathematical interests , the system eq11.08 is also partly motivated by the study of inhomogeneous fluids with density dependent viscosity ( see , for instance , <TARGET_CIT> ) , as well as equations describing flows of shear thinning and shear thickening fluids with viscosity depending on pressure ( see , for instance , <TARGET_CIT> )
o	It follows by induction with respect to the order <MATH> that all of the terms in ( ) are pure , and the associated long exact sequence breaks up into short exact sequences ( one for each cohomological degree ) , which are moreover split by semisimplicity of the category of pure mixed Hodge modules on <MATH> <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Mansour and Shattuck Mansour : Chebyshev - <TARGET_CIT> have since provided several refinements of the enumeration , such as the number of words in the language with a specified number of occurrences of <MATH> and <MATH> .
o	Moreover , in <TARGET_CIT> , the molecular characterization of <MATH> was established , which was further applied to study the boundedness of the fractional integral associated with <MATH> on <MATH> , and the dual space of <MATH> was also investigated .
o	In particular , this parameterization gives rise to real exponential polynomials , which can be represented in terms of hyperbolic functions of the form <MATH> , thereby inducing the class of hyperbolic splines <TARGET_CIT> , with redefined e - degree <MATH> .
o	We construct a family of Lagrangian tori <MATH> , <MATH> , where <MATH> , is the monotone twist Lagrangian torus described in <TARGET_CIT> .

o	The full result is from <TARGET_CIT> and uses an idea from <TARGET_CIT> .
o	We remark that SCCs yield better minimum Hamming distance than PCCs <TARGET_CIT> .
o	However , Bryant and Kovacs <TARGET_CIT> prove a striking result : given any <MATH> where <MATH> , there exists a <MATH> -generator <MATH> -group <MATH> such that <MATH> induces on <MATH> the linear group <MATH> .
o	The AFW dataset <TARGET_CIT> was collected from Flickr and the images in this dataset contain large variations in appearance and viewpoint . In total there are 205 images with 468 faces in this dataset .
p	Most remarkable observational discoveries in type - Ia supernovae ( SN Iae ) prevail that the universe has confirmed by two dark components containing dark energy ( DE ) and dark matter ( DM ) <TARGET_CIT> .

o	We saw in Section chirmass that generally the left and right handed parts of an <MATH> spinor <MATH> will not have the same mass , but whether there exists a successful mechanism for making the theory compatible with experiment is an open issue(See <TARGET_CIT> for a discussion about recent proposals on what may be a similar issue in the context of the fate of non - observed additional generations of particles in <MATH> grand unification schemes .
o	See Table 1 on p.365 in <TARGET_CIT> .
o	We will define the analogues of slices <MATH> of <TARGET_CIT> and prove that they are the Coulomb branches of the corresponding quiver gauge theories .
o	The fourth order estimate is not contained in the previous stated result ( but it is well - known , see e.g. <TARGET_CIT> ) Ito 's formula and our weak coercivity assumptions gives : <MATH> .
o	The proof is based on the polynomial ham sandwich theorem , which is due to Stone and Tukey <TARGET_CIT> .
o	The proof of Theorem thm 3 mainly depends on the extrapolation theorem for <MATH> ( see <TARGET_CIT> or Lemma lem extro below ) , which reduces the proof of Theorem thm 3 to some inequality in terms of the weighted Lebesgue space with constant exponent in <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Without turbulence and flow deflection , the analysis by <TARGET_CIT> predicts that at most fraction <MATH> of the incident kinetic energy <MATH> could be extracted .
o	Codes with prescribed automorphisms subsubsec_automorphisms_lower_cdc The computational complexity of the general optimization problem for <MATH> can be reduced if one assumes that the desired constant dimension code <MATH> admits some automorphisms , see <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Authors in Yagan / <TARGET_CIT> ( respectively , <TARGET_CIT> ) investigated the connectivity ( respectively , <MATH> -connectivity ) of WSNs secured by the classical EG scheme under an independent on / off channel model . However , when the network consists of sensors with varying level of resources ( e.g. , computational , memory , power ) , and with varying level of security and connectivity requirements , it may no longer be sensible to assign the same number of keys to all sensors .
o	In order to recover a morphism of inverse semigroups associated to a partial representation , there is a universal semigroup constructed upon the group <MATH> , called Exel 's semigroup <TARGET_CIT> :
o	exmp <TARGET_CIT> This example illustrates that partial actions of groups on geometric figures can be sensitive for the internal structure of these figures .

o	It is established in <TARGET_CIT> that the operator <MATH> is invertible and has real spectrum .
o	One of the main results in Iliman : deWolff : <TARGET_CIT> is the observation that lower bounds for global optimization problems arising from SONCs via GP can not only be computed faster , but also be better than the bounds obtained by SOS via SDP .
o	An alternative consists in a conservative cell - centered discretization , which was first introduced by Godunov in <TARGET_CIT> .
p	Another reference on the subject is the classic book <TARGET_CIT> .

o	See <TARGET_CIT> for further details on the statistical properties of crossings in our collections of dependency treebanks .
o	Furthermore , the right adjoint of <MATH> coincides with <MATH> ( cf . <TARGET_CIT> )
o	In any case , as Lesch rightly points out in <TARGET_CIT> , it is more difficult to prove Riesz continuity as compared to other operator topologies and therefore , our results should have interesting applications to the study of spectral flow and to index theory of Dirac operators .
o	The topological entropy of a meromorphic single - valued map is bounded from above by the logarithm of its largest dynamical degree ( Dinh and Sibony <TARGET_CIT> ) ; equality is conjectured .
o	This constant can be found only in a few cases ( see , e.g. , <TARGET_CIT> ) and is typically left to numerical approximation .
o	This mass is of the order of that associated with impulsive mass ejections as discussed in <TARGET_CIT> .
o	A basic <MATH> -column ( of <MATH> -type ) , defined for each <MATH> , is the highest weight element of the Young tableau realization <TARGET_CIT> of <MATH> .
p	The introduction of slide lines goes back to an idea of Wilkins Wilkins1964 , successively studied and refined by Caramana Caramana2009 , Barlow et al . <TARGET_CIT> and Loubere at al . LoubereSL2013 ; the main ideas adopted in their papers regard the subdivision of the nodes at the interface in master and slave nodes and the study of the forces between the two sides of the slide lines .

p	Introduction One of the most exciting new trends in is the search for a theory of noncommutative complex geometry <TARGET_CIT> .
o	See also <TARGET_CIT> for a discussion . <THEOREM> .
o	By <TARGET_CIT> , this defines an endofunctor on <MATH> -pointed monads , : H/()H/ ( ) , which is a lifting of <MATH> .
o	In the classical Johnson space the optimal combination of the corresponding two inequalities in a recursive application is unclear , see e.g. <TARGET_CIT> .
o	We refer the reader to <TARGET_CIT> for background on these varieties .
o	We now explain how to write an irreducible automorphic representation <MATH> on <MATH> as the " metaplectic restricted tensor product " <MATH> in the sense of <TARGET_CIT> Section 2 .

o	In our previous algorithm <TARGET_CIT> , we accelerate this part by using GPU .
o	By <TARGET_CIT> , <MATH> where <MATH> is the one - dimensional irreducible regulous component of <MATH> and <MATH> are the isolated points of <MATH> .
o	A more detailed analysis of the underlying structure of the system 's attractor is needed to clarify the origin of this diversity , for instance through a bifurcation analysis as in <TARGET_CIT> .
o	See <TARGET_CIT> for an introduction to the theory of harmonic polynomials .
p	A classical reference for problem ( Ste ) is <TARGET_CIT> .
o	For a recent survey paper , we refer to <TARGET_CIT> ; see also <TARGET_CIT> , , <TARGET_CIT> for related problems .
o	It is well - known that for  <MATH> , problem ( Ste ) provides the vibration modes of a free elastic membrane the total mass of which is  <MATH>  and is concentrated at the boundary with density  <MATH> ; see e.g. , <TARGET_CIT> .
o	As is pointed out in <TARGET_CIT> , such a boundary concentration phenomenon can be explained in any dimension  <MATH>  as follows .
o	We recall that for  <MATH>  problem ( Neu ) provides the vibration modes of a free elastic membrane with mass density  <MATH>  and total mass  <MATH>  ( see e.g. , <TARGET_CIT> )
o	It is not difficult to prove that for any  <MATH>  <MATH> . see <TARGET_CIT> , <TARGET_CIT> .
o	See also <TARGET_CIT> for a detailed analysis of the analogue problem for the biharmonic operator .
o	It is interesting to compare our results with those in <TARGET_CIT> , where authors consider the Neumann Laplacian in the annulus  <MATH>  and prove that for  <MATH>  the first positive eigenvalue is a decreasing function of  <MATH> .
o	We note that , despite the idea of the proof is rather simple and used also in other contexts ( see e.g. , <TARGET_CIT> ) , the rigorous application of this method requires lenghty computations , suitable Taylor 's expansions and estimates for the corresponding remainders , as well as recursive formulas for the cross - products of Bessel functions and their derivatives .
o	We also note that an asymptotic analysis of similar but different problems is contained in <TARGET_CIT> , where by the way explicit computations of the coefficients in the asymptotic expansions of the eigenvalues are not provided .
o	note that if  <MATH>  is not radial one could obtain a limiting Steklov - type problem with non - constant mass density , see <TARGET_CIT> for a general discussion )

o	Note that  <MATH>  is the Wronskian in  <MATH> , which is known to be  <MATH>  ( see <TARGET_CIT> )
o	By using the Min - Max Principle and related standard arguments , one can easily prove that  <MATH>  depends with continuity on  <MATH>  ( cfr . <TARGET_CIT> , see also <TARGET_CIT> )
o	It is well - known ( see <TARGET_CIT> ) that  <MATH> .
o	where  <MATH>  stands both for  <MATH>  and  <MATH>  ( see <TARGET_CIT> )
o	We use the recurrence relations  <MATH>  and  <MATH> , where  <MATH>  stands both for  <MATH>  and  <MATH>  ( see <TARGET_CIT> )
o	This theorem can be proved directly by using the notion of compact convergence for the resolvent operators ( see <TARGET_CIT> ) but can also be obtained as a consequence of the more general results proved in <TARGET_CIT> ( see also <TARGET_CIT> )
o	Second , the use of unlabeled data does not help general transduction , since supervised learning algorithms such as ERM and <TARGET_CIT> match our transductive lower bounds while ignoring the unlabeled test set .
o	Transductive learning <TARGET_CIT> considers two sets of data : a training set containing  <MATH>  labeled samples , and an unlabeled set containing  <MATH>  unlabeled samples .
p	More generally , transductive learning has found a wide and diverse range of successful applications , including text categorization , image colorization , image compression , image segmentation , reconstruction of protein interaction networks , speech tagging , and statistical machine translation ; all of these discussed and referenced in <TARGET_CIT>
o	For further discussions on transductive learning , see <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Our proofs are inspired by their counterparts in inductive learning <TARGET_CIT> , which rely on the worst case analysis of binary classification and the probabilistic method .
o	Second , we realize that the use of unlabeled data does not help general transductive learning , since supervised learning algorithms such as empirical risk minimization and the algorithm of <TARGET_CIT> match our transductive lower bounds while ignoring the unlabeled test set .
o	Third , we use our transductive lower bounds to derive lower bounds for semi - supervised learning , and relate them to the impossibility results of <TARGET_CIT> and <TARGET_CIT> .
o	In this paper , we analyze the two settings of transductive learning proposed by <TARGET_CIT> : itemize Setting I ( TLSI ) assumes a fixed population set  <MATH>  with  <MATH> .
o	Table table : settings summarizes the differences between TLSI and TLSII , when compared together with inductive supervised learning <TARGET_CIT> denoted by SL , and inductive semi - supervised learning <TARGET_CIT> , denoted by SSL .
o	The first two assumptions are commonly used throughout the literature in learning theory <TARGET_CIT> .
o	<TARGET_CIT> provides sharp upper bounds for Empirical Risk Minimization ( ERM ) in TLSI . However , these ERM upper bounds are only explicit for the  <MATH>  case .
o	Vap82 provides sharp upper bounds for Empirical Risk Minimization ( ERM ) in TLSI . However , these ERM upper bounds are only explicit for the  <MATH>  case . To amend this issue , <TARGET_CIT> extend these bounds to the  <MATH>  case . In particular , this results in an upper bound for ERM in TLSI of the order  <MATH> , where  <MATH>  is the VC - dimension of the learning hypothesis class  <MATH> .
o	Following a different approach , <TARGET_CIT> provide upper bounds depending on the hypothesis class prior distribution . Under realizability assumptions and good choices of hypothesis class prior distributions , these bounds lead to fast  <MATH>  learning rates .
p	Most recently , <TARGET_CIT> provide general bounds which achieve fast rates  <MATH>  under Tsybakov low noise assumptions , recovering the  <MATH>  upper bound of CM06 with looser constants .
n	Regarding TLSII , upper bounds are usually obtained from the corresponding upper bounds in TLSI <TARGET_CIT> . However , this strategy is in many cases suboptimal , as we will later address in Section sec : consequences .
p	Finding a lower bound to these values guarantees , for every possible transductive learning algorithm  <MATH> , the existence of learning problems which can not be solved by  <MATH>  faster than at a certain learning rate . This is the goal of the rest of this section . Our proofs are inspired by their analogous in the classical setting ( inductive and iid ) of statistical learning theory <TARGET_CIT> .
o	In particular , our arguments involve standard constructions based on  <MATH>  points shattered by  <MATH>  and the use of the probabilistic method <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Remarkably , the rates of our lower bounds are almost identical to the ones from the classical setting of statistical learning theory <TARGET_CIT> , which shows that general transduction is as hard as general induction .
o	using the Chebyshev - Cantelli inequality <TARGET_CIT>
o	First , Empirical Risk Minimization or ERM <TARGET_CIT> denoted by  <MATH> .
o	Second , the majority voting ensemble of ERMs trained on subsets of  <MATH>  proposed by <TARGET_CIT> , denoted by  <MATH> .
o	The argument is a slight modification of <TARGET_CIT> , and also follows from TBK14 .
o	<TARGET_CIT> precise this intuition , by showing that the total variation distance between these two distributions ( the one due to sampling without replacement versus the one due to sampling with replacement ) is bounded between  <MATH>  and  <MATH> .
o	In such limit case , the upper bound of ERM falls back to  <MATH> <TARGET_CIT> .
o	The analogous question in the iid setting served over twenty five years of research , where the series of works <TARGET_CIT> proved minimax lower bounds of the order  <MATH> .
o	At the same time , <TARGET_CIT> showed that the upper bound  <MATH>  is not improvable for ERM .
o	Only recently it was finally proved by <TARGET_CIT> that  <MATH>  rate is achieved by a majority voting supervised algorithm .
o	Unfortunately , the counterexample from <TARGET_CIT> does not apply to TLSI .
o	In particular , the following result is a direct consequence of <TARGET_CIT> and <TARGET_CIT> .
o	It is well known that upper bounds for TLSI lead to upper bounds for TLSII <TARGET_CIT> .
o	We bound this average by using Bernstein 's inequality <TARGET_CIT> and accounting for the fact that  <MATH>  and  <MATH>  can be upper bounded with high probability by using <TARGET_CIT> and <TARGET_CIT>
o	Surprisingly , the TLSII lower bound of Theorem thm : lower - exp - setting2 matches the best known lower bound for supervised learning <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Worst case lower bounds for agnostic semi - supervised learning firstly appeared in <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Moreover , the algorithm of <TARGET_CIT> , denoted by  <MATH> , exhibits upper bounds of the order  <MATH> .
o	This discussion relates to the conjectures of <TARGET_CIT> and <TARGET_CIT> .
o	First , <TARGET_CIT> conjectures that semi - supervised learning is impossible for any marginal distribution  <MATH> , since it is always possible to find a bad labeling mechanism  <MATH>  which renders the unlabeled set useless .
o	Second , unlabeled data does not help general transductive classification , since supervised learning algorithms , such as ERM and the algorithm of <TARGET_CIT> , match our transductive lower bounds while ignoring the unlabeled set .
o	Here we discuss the proof of <TARGET_CIT> and provide two slight improvements .
o	First , inspecting the step from Equation ( 46 ) to Equation ( 47 ) of the proof of <TARGET_CIT> reveals the inequality  <MATH> .
o	However , as argued in <TARGET_CIT> , all upper bounds in realizable transductive classification should have the form  <MATH> .
n	The discrepancy may be due to an inaccuracy in the proof of <TARGET_CIT> . Namely , the proof uses the inequality  <MATH>  but claims , in between Equations 37 and 38 , that " the case  <MATH>  can be treated similarly " . We conjecture that this is not the case : we could not find any similar argument that would lead to a result for the  <MATH>  case .
o	To improve the proof of <TARGET_CIT> , assume that the inequality  <MATH> . holds for some constant  <MATH> . Then , this is equivalent to <MATH> . which directly leads to the upper bound of Theorem thm : wrong , with a multiplicative factor of  <MATH>  in its denominator .
o	We may now use these expressions , together with  <MATH> , and the Chebyshev - Cantelli inequality <TARGET_CIT> , to obtain  <MATH> . which holds as long as  <MATH> .
o	Using this inequality and <TARGET_CIT> write  <MATH> where the first inequality is due the structure of a Binomial distribution with an even number of trials .
o	It is well known that upper bounds for TLSI lead to upper bounds for TLSII <TARGET_CIT>
o	Using Bernstein 's inequality <TARGET_CIT> together with the previous expectation and variance , we obtain  <MATH> .
o	On the other hand , using an upper bound of <TARGET_CIT> , we get <MATH> .
o	We can repeat the same argument for  <MATH>  and use the upper bound presented in <TARGET_CIT>
o	Next , we apply the Chebyshev - Cantelli inequality <TARGET_CIT> to lower bound the previous expression .
o	Next , we are interested in applying the Chebyshev - Cantelli inequality <TARGET_CIT> to the random variable  <MATH>  in eq : intermediate3 .
o	We are now ready to apply the Chebyshev - Cantelli inequality <TARGET_CIT> using the expectation eq : expectation3 and the variance eq : variance3 .
o	It results in increased capacitance between adjacent lines in on - chip buses <TARGET_CIT>
p	Another promising method for preventing the capacitive crosstalk is to exploit capacitive crosstalk avoidance codes <TARGET_CIT>
o	For example , if two consecutive words do not have any adjacent transition  <MATH> , the immunity to the capacitive crosstalk is expected to be improved <TARGET_CIT>
o	Pande et al . <TARGET_CIT> , Sridhara and Shanbhag <TARGET_CIT> presented coding schemes satisfing the condition that a codeword having the pattern  <MATH>  ( resp .  <MATH> ) are not followed by a codeword having the pattern  <MATH>  ( resp .  <MATH> ) at the same bit positions . They call the codes satisfying the above constraint forbidden overlap codes ( FOC )
o	The coding to avoid the transition patterns  <MATH>  is said to be forbidden transition coding ( FTC ) <TARGET_CIT> <TARGET_CIT> .
o	For example , Pande et al . <TARGET_CIT> proposed a simple 3-bit input/4-bit output stateless FTC .
o	Recently , Nisen and Kudekar presented an advanced joint FTC and ECC <TARGET_CIT> and showed a density evolution analysis .
o	Victor and Keutzer <TARGET_CIT> presented rate analyses for the  <MATH> -transition free word sequences in the case where both of an encoder and a decoder are stateful , and in the case where both of them are stateless . The asymptotic rates for combinations of a stateful encoder and a stateless decoder remains to be studied and thus it brings us a theoretical interest and challenge . The stateless decoder has a significant practical advantage over the stateful decoder because it can prevent error propagation at the decoder caused by decoding errors . The argument presented in this paper heavily relies on graph theory , especially on domatic partition problems <TARGET_CIT> and subgraph domatic partition problems <TARGET_CIT> .
o	The directed graph version of subgraph domatic partition ( SubDP ) problem was first discussed by Wadayama , Izumi and Ono <TARGET_CIT> .
o	The domatic number can be upper bounded by  <MATH> . which is called the degree bound <TARGET_CIT> .
o	A non - trivial lower bound proved by Feige et al . <TARGET_CIT> has the form :  <MATH> .
o	that is derived using Lovasz local lemma <TARGET_CIT> .
o	The SubDP problem proposed in <TARGET_CIT> is a natural extension of the domatic partition problem , which admits choosing an appropriate subgraph to increase the domatic number .
o	It should be noted that the subDP problem is proved to be NP - hard <TARGET_CIT> .
o	In the scenario of the data transmission over on - chip buses , it is reasonable to assume  <MATH>  ( FTC ) or  <MATH> ( FOC ) ) <TARGET_CIT> <TARGET_CIT> <TARGET_CIT> .
o	By exploiting a graph pruning method presented in <TARGET_CIT> , we can retrieve an induced subgraph  <MATH>  satisfying  <MATH> .
o	The lemma due to Feige et al . <TARGET_CIT> guarantees the existence of a domatic partition of  <MATH>  with the domatic number satisfying  <MATH> .
o	It is shown in <TARGET_CIT> that the asymptotic growth rate of the minimum degree of the  <MATH> -transition free graphs is given by  <MATH> .
o	In this paper we give a matrix version of Handelman 's Positivstellensatz <TARGET_CIT> , representing polynomial matrices which are positive definite on convex , compact polyhedra .
o	<MATH>  Polya <TARGET_CIT> proved in 1928 that for a homogeneous polynomial  <MATH> , if  <MATH>  for every  <MATH> , then there exists a sufficiently large number  <MATH>  such that all coefficients of the polynomial  <MATH>  are positive .
o	Powers and Reznick <TARGET_CIT> gave an explicit bound for the number  <MATH> , and applied it to give a constructive version of Handelman 's Positivstellensatz .
o	J.L. Krivine <TARGET_CIT> proved Handelman 's Positivstellensatz for a special polyhedron .
o	Moreover , one can find a generalization of this Positivstellensatz in <TARGET_CIT> ( or <TARGET_CIT> )
o	A bound for the number  <MATH>  was given by Powers and Reznick <TARGET_CIT> , using the bound for the number  <MATH>  in Polya 's Positivstellensatz .
o	This corollary is a special case of Schmudgen 's Positivstellensatz <TARGET_CIT> for convex , compact polyhedra which includes an explicit bound on the degrees of sums of squares coefficients  <MATH> .
o	A matrix version of Polya 's Positivstellensatz was given by Scherer and Hol <TARGET_CIT> , with applications e.g. in robust polynomial semi - definite programs .
o	Schmudgen 's theorem for operator polynomials has been discovered by Cimpric and Zalar <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Positivstellensatze for polynomial matrices have been studied by some other authors , see for example in <TARGET_CIT> , <TARGET_CIT> , <TARGET_CIT> , <TARGET_CIT> .
o	The main idea in the proof of this theorem inherits from Powers and Reznick <TARGET_CIT> , using a matrix version of Polya 's Positivstellensatz <TARGET_CIT> and the continuity of eigenvalue functions of the polynomial matrix  <MATH>  on the entries of  <MATH>  ( by <TARGET_CIT> )
o	Following Scherer and Hol <TARGET_CIT> , for each multi - index  <MATH> , let us denote  <MATH> !
o	With the spectral norm  <MATH> , following Scherer and Hol <TARGET_CIT> , we define  <MATH> .
o	Then it follows from Polya 's theorem for polynomial matrices <TARGET_CIT> , that for each  <MATH> ,  <MATH> .
o	By <TARGET_CIT> , there exist positive numbers  <MATH>  such that  <MATH> .
o	It follows from <TARGET_CIT> that  <MATH>  is a continuous function on  <MATH> ,  <MATH> .
o	The proof goes along the same lines as the proof of <TARGET_CIT> , using continuity of the function  <MATH> .
o	Firstly , applying the matrix version of Polya 's Positivstellensatz given in <TARGET_CIT> for  <MATH> , observing that  <MATH> .
o	Following <TARGET_CIT> to find positive constants  <MATH>  such that  <MATH> .
o	It follows from <TARGET_CIT> that  <MATH>  are continuous functions .
o	This work has been in part presented at The 17th IEEE International Workshop on Signal Processing Advances in Wireless Communications 2016 ( SPAWC 2016 ) <TARGET_CIT> .
p	The emerging massive multiple - input multiple - output ( MIMO ) architecture promises tremendous performance gains in terms of network throughput and energy efficiency by employing simple coherent processing across arrays of hundreds or even thousands of base station ( BS ) antennas , serving tens or hundreds of mobile terminals <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Thereby , physical layer channel impairments such as fading , additive Gaussian noise , and interference are averaged out in the limit of an infinite number of antennas <TARGET_CIT> - <TARGET_CIT> .
o	As an additional benefit , massive MIMO is inherently more secure than conventional MIMO systems , as the large - scale antenna array equipped at the transmitter ( Alice ) can accurately focus a narrow and directional information beam on the intended terminal ( Bob ) , such that the received signal power at Bob is several orders of magnitude higher than that at any incoherent passive eavesdropper ( Eve ) <TARGET_CIT> .
o	In this case , unless additional measures to secure the communication are taken by Alice , even a single passive Eve may be able to intercept the signal intended for Bob <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Physical layer security for conventional ( non - massive ) MIMO transmission has been extensively studied in the literature , e.g. <TARGET_CIT> .
o	A large system secrecy analysis of MIMO systems was provided in <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Artificial noise ( AN ) generation <TARGET_CIT> was employed to provide physical layer security in a multi - cell massive MIMO system with pilot contamination in <TARGET_CIT> for the case when Eve 's CSI is not known .
p	Nevertheless , it was revealed in <TARGET_CIT> that significant additional performance gains are possible with more sophisticated data and AN precoders , including polynomial precoders .
o	Furthermore , AN - aided jamming of Rician fading massive MIMO channels was investigated in <TARGET_CIT> .
o	In the context of massive MIMO relaying , the work presented in <TARGET_CIT> compared two classic relaying schemes , i.e. , amplify - and forward ( AF ) and decode - and - forward ( DF ) , for physical layer security with imperfect CSI at the massive MIMO relay .
o	While <TARGET_CIT> - <TARGET_CIT> assumed that Eve is passive , the so - called pilot contamination attack , a form of active eavesdropping , was also considered in the literature .
o	In particular , several techniques for detection of the pilot contamination attack were proposed in <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Moreover , the authors in <TARGET_CIT> developed a secret key agreement protocol under the pilot contamination attack , and the authors in <TARGET_CIT> proposed to encrypt the pilot sequence in order to hide it from the attacker .
o	While zhu - chen1 assumed that Eve is passive , the so - called pilot contamination attack , a form of active eavesdropping , was also considered in the literature . In particular , several techniques for detection of the pilot contamination attack were proposed in phymassive . Moreover , the authors in SKA developed a secret key agreement protocol under the pilot contamination attack , and the authors in phymassive2 proposed to encrypt the pilot sequence in order to hide it from the attacker . Several techniques for combating the pilot contamination attack at the physical layer of a multi - cell massive MIMO system were proposed in <TARGET_CIT> .
n	Nevertheless , all practical implementations do suffer from HWIs such as phase noise , quantization errors , amplification noise , and nonlinearities <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Although HWIs can be mitigated by analog and digital signal processing techniques <TARGET_CIT> , they can not be removed completely , due to the randomness introduced by the different sources of imperfection .
o	The remaining residual HWIs can be modelled by a combination of phase noise and additive distortion noises at the transmitter and the receiver <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Several works have investigated the impact of HWIs on massive MIMO systems <TARGET_CIT> , <TARGET_CIT> - <TARGET_CIT> .
o	The impact of phase noise originating from free - running oscillators on the downlink performance of massive MIMO systems was studied in <TARGET_CIT> for different linear precoder designs .
o	Constant envelope precoding for massive MIMO was studied in <TARGET_CIT> and <TARGET_CIT> with the objective of avoiding distortions caused by power amplifier nonlinearities at the transmitter .
o	The impact of the aggregate effects of several HWIs originating from different sources on massive MIMO systems was studied in <TARGET_CIT> by modelling the residual impairments remaining after compensation as additive distortion noises <TARGET_CIT> .
o	The authors in <TARGET_CIT> presented closed - form expressions for the achievable user rates in uplink massive MIMO systems for a general residual HWI model including both multiplicative phase noise and additive distortion noise .
o	To overcome the latter effect , so - called temporally orthogonal ( TO ) and spatially orthogonal ( SO ) pilot sequences were investigated in <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Furthermore , the impact of the number of local oscillators ( LOs ) employed at the massive MIMO BS on performance in the presence of phase noise was studied in <TARGET_CIT> , while the effect of HWIs on full - duplex massive MIMO relaying was considered in <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Communication secrecy aspects are not adequately considered in existing works studying the impact of HWIs in the context of massive MIMO system design <TARGET_CIT> , <TARGET_CIT> - <TARGET_CIT> .
n	This disparity in equipment quality was not considered in the related work on physical layer security <TARGET_CIT> - <TARGET_CIT> nor in the related work on HWIs <TARGET_CIT> , <TARGET_CIT> - <TARGET_CIT> and necessitates the development of a new analysis and design framework .
p	For example , NS AN precoding , which was widely used to enhance the achievable secrecy rate of massive MIMO systems <TARGET_CIT> , becomes ineffective in the presence of phase noise .
o	Thereby , we focus on the downlink and adopt for the legitimate links the generic residual HWI model from <TARGET_CIT> , which includes the effects of multiplicative phase noise and additive distortion noise at the BS and the users .
o	We generalize the SO and TO pilot sequence designs from <TARGET_CIT> to orthogonal pilot sequences with arbitrary numbers of non - zero elements .
o	Similar to <TARGET_CIT> , we assume that after proper compensation the residual HWIs manifest themselves at the BS and the MTs in the form of
o	In massive MIMO systems , the CSI is usually acquired via uplink training by exploiting the channel reciprocity between uplink and downlink in time - division duplex ( TDD ) mode <TARGET_CIT> .
o	We adopt a per - pilot power constraint , as in practice , systems are peak power limited , e.g. , , <TARGET_CIT> .
o	We note that the proposed pilot design is a generalization of the SO and TO pilot designs proposed in <TARGET_CIT> which result as special cases for  <MATH>  and  <MATH> , respectively .
o	Phase noise : Matrix  <MATH> . models the phase noise originating from the free - running LOs equipped at the BS and the MTs <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Adopting the discrete - time Wiener phase noise model <TARGET_CIT> ,
o	2 ) Distortion noise :  <MATH>  and  <MATH>  model the additive distortion noises at the  <MATH>  MT and the BS , respectively , which originate from residual effects after compensation of HWIs such as power amplifier non - linearities at the transmitter , quantization noise in the analog - to - digital converters ( ADCs ) at the receiver , etc . <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Distortion noise is modeled as a Gaussian distributed random process in the literature <TARGET_CIT> .
o	This model has been experimentally verified in <TARGET_CIT> . Furthermore , at each antenna , the distortion noise power is proportional to the corresponding signal power , i.e. ,  <MATH>  and  <MATH> , where  <MATH> . Here ,  <MATH> , where  <MATH>  denotes the  <MATH>  element of  <MATH> , and parameters  <MATH>  denote the ratio between the additive distortion noise variance and the signal power and are measures for the severity of the residual HWIs . Amplified thermal noise :  <MATH>  models the thermal noise amplified by the low noise amplifier and other components such as mixers at the receiver <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Distortion noise is modeled as a Gaussian distributed random process in the literature <TARGET_CIT> .
o	It is but a slight variation of the proof of <TARGET_CIT> .
o	For multivariate extremes ( <MATH> ) , non - parametric estimation of indicators of extremal dependence is an intensively studied field , and includes estimation of the Pickands or extremal dependence function <TARGET_CIT> , the tail dependence function <TARGET_CIT> , and the spectral measure <TARGET_CIT> .

o	We will mainly use two special cases : the external product of mixed Hodge modules with trivial monodromy in the sense of Definition , where the proposition is <TARGET_CIT> , and the case where <MATH> and <MATH> are a point , where the proposition is a special case of <TARGET_CIT> .
p	In particular , for swirl ratios in the relevant range , keeping the updraft in the convection chamber fixed and increasing the angular momentum in the convergence zone of the chamber resulted in decrease of the radius of the supercritical vortex and its length , while the axial velocity as well as the azimuthal velocity of the supercritical vortex increased . <TARGET_CIT> combined the results of these experimental vortex chamber studies and the theoretical studies by <TARGET_CIT> , all of which contributed to the identification of quantitative relationships between the radius of the supercritical vortex and the amount of angular momentum added to the flow , as well as relationships between its axial and azimuthal velocity components and the added angular momentum .

o	In any case , the end result is that using the string web technology developed in <TARGET_CIT> we can associate to each root <MATH> of <MATH> a set of singularities which collide when <MATH> satisfies <MATH> .
o	The same result <TARGET_CIT> also explains that since <MATH> is a separable metric space , so is <MATH> with its narrow topology ( be aware that Lusin as a different meaning though in this result of DellacherieMeyer ) , hence <MATH> is a Lusin separable metric space as <MATH> is .
o	This is basically <TARGET_CIT> , but our proof is a little different , in part because our setup is different , by Remark .
o	Throughout , we propose to estimate <MATH> and <MATH> , <MATH> , <MATH> and <MATH> , using <MATH> . as it is done in , e.g. , <TARGET_CIT> .

o	We suspect that all such braidings and coalescences must be equivalent by virtue of the Weyl <MATH> action , but we do not have a proof , since the way the braid group and Weyl group actions are related seems complicated ; cf . , <TARGET_CIT> .
n	While their estimation is interestingly of the right order ( namely <MATH> ) , the authors of <TARGET_CIT> did not pursue on giving an upper bound of the constant appearing in their rate function , see Claim <MATH> and <MATH> of Point <MATH> in <TARGET_CIT> . Unfortunately , the constant <MATH> appearing in the rate function is of crucial importance when deriving phase transitions , see Section sec : main for instance .

o	Here , we are interested in numerical algorithms which ( a ) apply to general symmetric matrices without any structural assumptions or dimensional restrictions and ( b ) are not merely recursive , i.e. , do not rely on information taken from all principal submatrices , but rather focus on generating subproblems in a somehow data - driven way , as described in <TARGET_CIT> .
o	A greedy - type approach has been considered by Alexander Shishkin , see <TARGET_CIT> and also <TARGET_CIT> .
n	In consequence <MATH> is a <MATH> -scaled standard simplex and by the previous example our approach coincides with the one in Ghasemi : Marshall : GP : <TARGET_CIT> .

o	Since the matrix is an analogue ( and in fact the reciprocal ) of Shahidi 's local coefficient in the linear algebraic case ( cf . <TARGET_CIT> ) , we call it the Shahidi local coefficient matrix in this paper .
o	Prominent architectures for analog simulation are based on cold atoms in optical lattices <TARGET_CIT> , trapped ions <TARGET_CIT> or superconducting qubits <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Also , we adopt the message passing analysis that was developed in a series of papers DoMaMoNSPT . The notion of phase transition we consider is similar to the one introduced in DoMaMoNSPT . However , there are three major differences : ( i ) The analysis of <TARGET_CIT> is performed for LASSO , while we have generalized the analysis to any LQLS with <MATH> . ( ii ) The analysis of DoMaMoNSPT is performed on the least favorable distribution for LASSO , while here we characterize the effect of the distribution of <MATH> on the AMSE as well . ( iii ) Finally , DoMaMoNSPT is only concerned with the first dominant term in AMSE of LASSO , while we derive the second dominant term whose importance has been discussed in the last few sections .

n	Lai and Robbins provide such a lower bound in <TARGET_CIT> , but under the assumption ( not satisfied here ) that , for all <MATH> , <MATH> has a <MATH> regret on every bandit model . Moreover their lower bound is asymptotic , which makes it more complicated to integrate .
o	Then by the Dominated Convergence Theorem <TARGET_CIT> <MATH> .
o	Such problems arise when the objective function is evaluated by running a complex computer code ( see , e.g. , <TARGET_CIT> ) , performing a laboratory experiment , or building a prototype system to be evaluated in the real world .

o	We know from Equation 4.10 in <TARGET_CIT> , that the number of triangles in a input graph <MATH> sampled from <MATH> is <MATH> with probability <MATH> , and hence the size of <MATH> contains all except at most a <MATH> -fraction of the graphs in <MATH> .

o	Riegler et al . <TARGET_CIT> showed that the matrix recovery problem has a unique solution if the number <MATH> of linear measurements is greater than the lower Minkowski dimension of the constraint set , which implies , for example , that <MATH> is sufficient to guarantee the uniqueness of the solution when the constraint set is defined by eq : csl . In this section , we show that for random measurement matrices that follow certain distributions , the same sample complexity can also guarantee stability , with high probability .
o	Another diffusive transition was observed when the fcc lattice of soft NIPA spheres transforms into a bct lattice driven by an electric field ; however , the reverse bct to fcc transition is martensitic <TARGET_CIT> .
p	In practice , limited transmission range of sensors significantly impacts the wireless connectivity of a WSN , hence the disk model <TARGET_CIT> can be seen as a good candidate model for wireless connectivity among sensor nodes .
o	The 1D interaction constant <MATH> can be related to the 3D scattering length <MATH> of the atoms , the wave guide trap frequency <MATH> and length scale <MATH> by <MATH> with <MATH> <TARGET_CIT> .
o	We define <MATH> as in <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Stronger versions of these results also follow from the work of Valeriote and Willard valeriote.willard14 , who proved that every idempotent variety that is not <MATH> -permutable for any <MATH> is interpretable in the variety of distributive lattices , and the work of Kearnes and Kiss <TARGET_CIT> , who proved that any idempotent variety which does not satisfy a non - trivial congruence identity is interpretable in the variety of semilattices .
o	Another distinction principle that one could apply is due to Jacquet <TARGET_CIT> ( and later refined by Feigon , Lapid , and Offen in <TARGET_CIT> ) , which states that a form on <MATH> with a nonvanishing <MATH> period must come from quadratic base change .
o	It has been shown in our recent publication that sampling with the Gaussian function of the kind <MATH> , where <MATH> is the step between two adjacent sampling points and <MATH> is the fitting parameter , leads to the approximation for the inverse Fourier transform as given by <TARGET_CIT> <MATH> .
o	The rest of the proof is similar to <TARGET_CIT> and left to the reader .
o	It can also be extracted from <TARGET_CIT> that the map <MATH> is injective on <MATH> .
o	For the proof here and later for Beta distributions , we use the following bounds ( see Lemma 4.1 in <TARGET_CIT> ) <MATH> .
o	Indeed , taking <MATH> to be one of the multifractal spectrum sets <MATH> for <MATH> studied in gms- mf - <TARGET_CIT> gives a counterexample . <REMARK> .
o	For any such small instance <MATH> , we can always verify our combinatorial computation of toric ED degrees using the general algebraic method in <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Liquidity is stochastic in that the volume effect process , which determines the inter - temporal resilience of the market in spirit of <TARGET_CIT> , is taken to be stochastic , being driven by own random noise .
o	His result is the cornerstone of a wealth of further characterizations of complexity classes , cf . the monographs <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Consequently , by using <TARGET_CIT> and the Projective Bundle Theorem as it has been done in the even case , one get that <MATH> for all <MATH> , <MATH> and <MATH> in <MATH> .
o	Following <TARGET_CIT> , we will denote the closure <MATH> by <MATH> .

o	For example the MOSS algorithm <TARGET_CIT> , based on the index <MATH> is designed to be optimal in a minimax sense for bandit models with sub - gaussian rewards : the algorithm achieves a <MATH> distribution - independent upper bound on the regret . Besides , it was already noted by AOKLUCB that the use of the exploration rate <MATH> in place of <MATH> in the kl - UCB algorithm leads to better empirical performance .
p	In particular they settled a conjecture of Sprindzuk by establishing that every analytic submanifold of <MATH> that is not contained in a proper affine subspace is extremal ( see beresnevich - <TARGET_CIT> for the state of the art before their work )
o	Robustness to process variability of mutual inductance Our realization of a multi - qubit fully connected effective 2-body graph is based on an experimentally proven design for a single coupler van - den - <TARGET_CIT> .
o	It is always possible to endow <MATH> with a ( essentially unique ) Hermitian metric with respect to which <MATH> is an anti - unitary map between conjugate fibers denittis - <TARGET_CIT> .
p	This paradigm shift from treating covariances as latent towards directly modeling ex - post covariance measures constructed from intraday data <TARGET_CIT> has spurred additional interest . Although the theory is appealing and intuitive , it assumes that the observed high - frequency data represent the underlying process . Nevertheless , the real - world data contains microstructure noise and jumps , which makes drawing statistical inferences rather difficult .
o	In the case of Euclidean space , it follows from log - Sobolev inequality of L. Gross <TARGET_CIT> that thm <MATH> .
o	Linear graph sketches ( Section sec : overview ) were originally used to process dynamic graphs in the ( semi- ) streaming model <TARGET_CIT> .
o	When also internal ( unobservable ) actions of systems are taken into account , the most studied generalization of bisimilarity is weak bisimilarity Milner : <TARGET_CIT> but the relevance of the finer equivalence called branching bisimilarity is also well argued DBLP : journals / jacm / GlabbeekW96 .
o	In particular , it does not readily extend to delay and weak bisimilarity <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Introduction In <TARGET_CIT> , Fukaya - Oh - Ohta - Ono construct a one - dimensional family of non - displaceable Lagrangian tori in <MATH> . They arise as fibres of a ( informally called ) semi - toric moment map Wu15 , where the fibres over the interior of the semi - toric moment polytope are Lagrangian tori , but over a special vertex of the polytope lies a Lagrangian <MATH> ( the anti - diagonal ) where the semi - toric moment map is not differentiable .
p	In recent decades , Solid Mechanics has made significant advancements in describing the structure of materials at various length and time scales ranging from electrons to large scale engineering structures <TARGET_CIT> .
o	However , while some classes of non - crossing dependency structures have a very good empirical coverage of real sentences kuhlmann06 , these proposals still face counterexamples that fall outside the restrictions <TARGET_CIT> .
p	Heuristic modifications of APPR have also been proposed which have successfully aimed at improving its performance , e.g. , those that use different rules to update the iterates and/or to terminate iterations <TARGET_CIT> .
o	The origin of the formula from the Main Theorem is explained in terms of the path - space approach to integrability of Dirac structures <TARGET_CIT> ; we explain that our Main Theorem can be used to find explicit models for local presymplectic groupoids ; we give the necessary ingredients to extend our results to twisted Dirac structures ; and finally , we discuss the relation between dual pairs and Morita equivalence in Poisson geometry .
o	Sets generated by MOEA / D In order to test if the observations made for artificial sets hold for sets generated by real evolutionary algorithms , we use sets of points generated by well - known MOEA / D algorithm <TARGET_CIT> for multiobjective multidimensional knapsack problem instances with 2 to 6 objectives .
o	Therefore , for any <MATH> such that <MATH> , one has , see Remark rem : Maulik , that <MATH> solves eq : fe1 at least for <MATH> , which in the case <MATH> is thanks to Maulik - <TARGET_CIT> and for <MATH> thanks to Arista - <TARGET_CIT> ( in fact the extension from <MATH> to <MATH> is a simple analytical exercise )
o	For symmetric monoidal dagger categories , there is also a notion of commutativity for strong monads kock : <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Reduction to linear algebra We apply the techniques of van Wamelen <TARGET_CIT> .
o	In the proof we need Li - Schoen 's trick of bounding high power by lower power Li - <TARGET_CIT> .
o	<TARGET_CIT> uses variational inference in a probabilistic model to combine the tasks of segmentation , clustering , and annotation .
o	In addition , the mass of <MATH> is well defined and is equal to that of <MATH> , by the same argument in <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Meanwhile , Barvinok and Hartigan <TARGET_CIT> extended the case of <MATH> to a much wider range of degrees .
p	The run - time test has been compared with current version of the Ab - Initio group of MIT implementation developed by Steven Johnson in C / C++ programming language <TARGET_CIT> . This implementation utilizes a large number of approximations and , therefore , can not be translated directly into Matlab code for rapid computation . However , as a C / C++ implementation it is well - optimized for the rapid and highly accurate computation of the family of the Faddeeva functions with relative error smaller than <MATH> Johnson .
o	We also remark that the recent paper zhan - nat - <TARGET_CIT> proves a Euclidean variant of Theorems thm - length - kpz and thm - length - kpz '
o	Moreover , we show that it reduces to the old version of the FKMM - invariant described in denittis - <TARGET_CIT> , and so to the Fu - Kane - Mele indices in the case of spaces with a discrete number of fixed points .
o	Recall that an involution <MATH> on <MATH> is said to be <MATH> -proper if , for all <MATH> , <MATH> implies <MATH> for each <MATH> and that it is positive definite if it is <MATH> -proper for every <MATH> By <TARGET_CIT> , <MATH> is a complete invariant for ultramatricial <MATH> -algebras over an algebraically closed field with the identity involution which is positive definite .
o	Wireless Connectivity Our paper aims to answer this question , hence bridging the disconnect between the model developed in Yagan / <TARGET_CIT> and real world implementations of WSNs where wireless channels are scarce and the full - visibility assumption does not hold .
o	Codes with prescribed automorphisms subsubsec_automorphisms_lower_cdc The computational complexity of the general optimization problem for <MATH> can be reduced if one assumes that the desired constant dimension code <MATH> admits some automorphisms , see <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Such argument is originally due to G. Lebeau , dating back to his work <TARGET_CIT> which uses the propagation of ( classical ) defect measures ; see for example <TARGET_CIT> for the semiclassical setting .
o	In <TARGET_CIT> , <MATH> 's follow iid <MATH> for some error covariance matrix <MATH> .
o	The hypergeometric approach la Deligne - Mostow is developed in the dizygotic twin paper <TARGET_CIT> .
n	An attempt to find the AEs for a general HGF was made recently by Paris <TARGET_CIT> , who reverted to the MSD to obtain the expansion of <MATH> for <MATH> , with <MATH> taking any finite value . These expansions , however , have their own restrictions on the regions of validity in the <MATH> -plane ( e.g. <MATH> for the case <MATH> in Paris:2013:173 ) , and , as we show later , these restrictions increase when one uses the stated transformations to go from the primary parameter set <MATH> to other cases in the class <MATH> , and analogously in the classes <MATH> and <MATH> .
o	We start by recalling <TARGET_CIT> : definition An operator <MATH> is called <MATH> -almost self - adjoint first - order elliptic ( <MATH> -ASAFOE ) if it is of the form <MATH> L = L_0+h <MATH> where itemize <MATH> is a first - order , self - adjoint , elliptic differential operator ( with smooth coefficients ) acting on sections of a vector bundle <MATH> ;
n	This fact has numerous applications in stochastic processes : the Karhunen - Loeve series expansion BTA04 , equivalence and orthogonality of Gaussian measures Sh66 , asymptotics of the small ball probabilities LiS01 , sampling from heavy tailed distributions VT13 , non - central limit theorems <TARGET_CIT> are only a few problems to mention . However the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are notoriously hard to find explicitly .
o	In fact , the classical Lebesgue measure does not exist in spaces of infinite dimension <TARGET_CIT> .
o	<MATH> Following Kleiman <TARGET_CIT> , we can also define <MATH> using the multidegree of the conormal variety <MATH> .
p	Approximate Personalized PageRank ( APPR ) , was first introduced in the seminal work of <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Since the ground state thermodynamic limit equations of the attractive Yang - Gaudin model are available in the literature ( e.g. <TARGET_CIT> ) , we will not explain how these are to be obtained from the finite - system discrete equations .
o	We can think of each <MATH> as a point in the compact graphon space <MATH> of L. Lovasz and B. Szegedy <TARGET_CIT> , and consider the uniform probability measure on these <MATH> points .
o	This holds for ordinary characters and also for Brauer characters by <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Anisotropic particles exhibit rich phases , but studies of their phase transitions are limited ; these include the crystallization of polyhedrons <TARGET_CIT> , self - propelled particles <TARGET_CIT> , and solid - solid transitions between square and canted cubic crystallites <TARGET_CIT> .
o	One way to expand the family is to add dependencies between the variables <TARGET_CIT> ; this is called structured variational inference .
o	We introduce an important quantity <MATH> which is intrinsic to the underlying space <MATH> <TARGET_CIT> : <MATH> .
o	It was shown in <TARGET_CIT> that both <MATH> and <MATH> are crystals that are isomorphic to <MATH> .

o	Lemma strengthen the result of <TARGET_CIT> and <TARGET_CIT> , showing that the minimal Maslov number <MATH> of any Lagrangian torus <MATH> ( or any orientable Lagrangian such that the cohomology ring is generated by <MATH> ) in <MATH> is 2 , provided <MATH> satisfies Assumption for some <MATH> .
o	In this subsection we present a Dani correspondence for matrices that is valid in the quasi - norm setting . A similar correspondence was worked out by Kleinbock and Margulis already in the matrix context in their work on logarithm laws kleinbock - margulis - <TARGET_CIT> .
o	The latter condition implies that <MATH> if <MATH> is real - valued ( see Proposition 2.17 <MATH> of <TARGET_CIT> for a proof of this implication )
o	Recall that the annihilator <MATH> is the two - sided ideal in <MATH> which consists of all <MATH> -morphism annihilated by <MATH> , see <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Therefore , the process of approximating a nonlinear functional is basically the same as approximating a nonlinear operator <TARGET_CIT> .
o	This unique functional also plays a role in a new - way integral ( Euler products with non - unique models ) for covering groups ; see Ginzburg <TARGET_CIT> .
o	The variety <MATH> is open in <MATH> ( see e.g. the proof of <TARGET_CIT> ) , and so these schemes have the same dimension , and there is an isomorphism <MATH> .
o	The sketch update works in <MATH> time ( see <TARGET_CIT> and Appendix app : sparse ) so the total running time is <MATH> per round .
o	This structural result is here a bit reworked and presented in a technically new framework ; it is shown that the quotient of branching bisimulation equivalence on nBPA is a rational monoid ( in the sense of Sakarovitch DBLP : journals / iandc / <TARGET_CIT> )
o	To establish the boundedness of <MATH> on <MATH> , we also need the following technical lemma , which was proved in <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Recent results of <TARGET_CIT> suggest vorticity is produced baroclinicly in the rear flank downdraft , it then descends to the surface and is tilted into the vertical , and this process is linked to tornadogenesis .
p	Following the influential account of <TARGET_CIT> , we can isolate two characteristic features of a universality argument : i ) Details of microstructure of a given token system are largely irrelevant for describing behaviour generically exhibited by members of the system type ; and ii ) Many different system types , with physically distinct microstructure ( e.g.
n	A frequently used approach allowing reduction of the time needed to update a Pareto archive is the use of bounded archives <TARGET_CIT> where the number of points is limited and some potentially non - dominated points are discarded . Please note , however , that such an approach always reduces the quality of the archive . In particular , one of the discarded points could be the one that would be selected by the decision maker if the full archive was known . Bounded archives may be especially disadvantageous in the case of many - objective problems , since with a growing number of dimensions it is more and more difficult to represent a large set with a smaller sample of points . The use of bounded archives may also lead to some technical difficulties in MOEAs ( see Fieldsend2003 )
o	Where there is uncertainty , there will be unintended consequences , which might be welcome or hazardous ( Kashyap key-41 - <TARGET_CIT> )
o	Restricting <MATH> if necessary , we see using kleinbock - <TARGET_CIT> that there exist constants <MATH> and a neighborhood <MATH> of <MATH> such that all functions <MATH> are <MATH> -good on <MATH> with respect to <MATH> .
o	For <MATH> , we parameterize <MATH> by <MATH> -quantum natural time with respect to <MATH> ( which is defined in <TARGET_CIT> and reviewed in Section sec - sle - kpz ' below )
o	By <TARGET_CIT> any infinite algebraic extension of a finite field is a PAC field .
o	While the idea of data sketching is widely studied <TARGET_CIT> , as far as we know our work is the first one to apply it to a general adversarial online learning setting and provide rigorous regret guarantees .
o	Following <TARGET_CIT> we define <MATH> .
o	Again under technical assumptions that we shall ignore , <MATH> is equal to a group constructed by Gaitsgory and Nadler ; see Section 3 of <TARGET_CIT> , in particular Section 3.2 .
o	In analogy to <TARGET_CIT> , this corollary can be translated into an explicit positive formula for the polar degrees and hence for the ED degree of <MATH> .
o	As shown in Ref . <TARGET_CIT> , the parameters <MATH> and <MATH> are not independent of each other .
o	The previous situation can not happen when <MATH> divides <MATH> , as in this case the results of <TARGET_CIT> show that when <MATH> the reduction is equal to <MATH> , not <MATH> .
o	Since <MATH> is an Oka manifold , we can apply the 1-parametric Oka property with interpolation on the pair of points <MATH> in order to deform the homotopy <MATH> with fixed ends <MATH> and <MATH> to a homotopy <MATH> consisting of holomorphic maps <MATH> such that <MATH> and <MATH> for all <MATH> ( see <TARGET_CIT> )
o	Complex repulsions involving two or more length scales can result in various superlattices <TARGET_CIT> and quasicrystals <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Equivalently , it is essentially due to the fact that the analogous Casselman - Shalika formula for covering groups as in <TARGET_CIT> and <TARGET_CIT> is vector - valued , whereas for linear algebraic groups it is scalar - valued ( cf .
n	For this boundary issue , Yoon and Kweon <TARGET_CIT> propose an adaptive support - window technique that uses the joint bilateral filtering <TARGET_CIT> for cost filtering . Although this adaptive window technique successfully deals with the boundary issue Hosni12 , it involves <MATH> of computation because of the complexity of the bilateral filtering .
o	Note that the case where assump holds is dealt with in Catanese - <TARGET_CIT> ; according to the authors , the classification of two - dimensional tori which admit an automorphism of order <MATH> acting faithfully ( such that assump holds ) is as follows .
p	The case <MATH> corresponds to an even ( or bosonic ) TRS . In this event , the spectral vector bundle <MATH> turns out to be equipped with an additional structure named Real by M. F. Atiyah in atiyah-66 . Therefore , in the presence of an even TRS the classification problem of the topological phases is reduced to the study of the set <MATH> of isomorphism classes of rank <MATH> vector bundles over <MATH> endowed with a Real structure . This problem has been analyzed and solved in denittis - <TARGET_CIT> .
o	In <TARGET_CIT> the maximal prolongation of the direct sum of these two calculi is shown to have a unique covariant complex structure <MATH> .
o	This is the ED degree ( cf . <TARGET_CIT> ) of the toric variety <MATH> .
p	A few years after the bilinear results , Bennett , Carbery , and Tao <TARGET_CIT> proved a sharp <MATH> -linear estimate for <MATH> . <THEOREM> . This theorem is important and remarkable in part because it involves the sharp exponent for the restriction problem : <MATH> .
o	Unlike crystallization in flat space , colloidal spheres on a liquid droplet surface nucleate into fractal - like crystalline patches ( FIG . 5e ) rather than a large crystal , because of curvature - induced strain <TARGET_CIT> ( FIG . 5b )
o	The following definition is inspired in <TARGET_CIT> .
o	The relation of this approach of recovering Weyl gravity from a gauge theory of gravity to Cartan 's conception of geometry has recently been discussed in detail(The link between Cartan geometry and conformal physics has previously been investigated in the case of <MATH> spacetime dimensions <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Moreover , we are mostly interested in determining when the space of Whittaker functionals for <MATH> has dimension one , in which case <MATH> is called distinguished following Suzuki in <TARGET_CIT> .
o	This absorption feature has been observed in several type II <TARGET_CIT> at both early or late photospheric epoch and goes by the name of ' cachito ' <TARGET_CIT> .
o	The previous result is the counterpart of <TARGET_CIT> for <MATH> -actions .
o	Deformations of this operator have previously appeared in the literature <TARGET_CIT> in the context of spectral triples <TARGET_CIT> .
o	We have <MATH> ( cf . <TARGET_CIT> ) and set <MATH> , which is a Riemannian orbifold .
o	We finish our results by pointing out that the family given in <TARGET_CIT> remain non - displaceable after we perform two blowups ( of the same size ) on the rank zero corners of the singular fibration described in <TARGET_CIT> , see Figure .
o	Its discrete analogue , introduced by Alon <TARGET_CIT> , plays a similar role in spectral graph theory ( see for instance Chapter 2 of <TARGET_CIT> )
o	Indeed , this non - uniqueness of the SW one form was already pointed out in <TARGET_CIT> and discussed further in <TARGET_CIT> .
o	We assume <MATH> follows an Ornstein - Uhlenbeck process <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Following <TARGET_CIT> , for each of the remaining semantic types , a vector space representation of the corresponding entities was obtained using Positive Pointwise Mutual Information ( PPMI )
o	Humans are remarkably adept at overcoming such challenges <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Here we present a conditionally conjugate Bayesian linear regression model with an ARD prior , based on <TARGET_CIT> .
o	First , Goresky and MacPherson display a bilinear form , <MATH> , which becomes non degenerate after tensoring with the rationals , cf . <TARGET_CIT> .
n	A frequently used approach allowing reduction of the time needed to update a Pareto archive is the use of bounded archives <TARGET_CIT> where the number of points is limited and some potentially non - dominated points are discarded . Please note , however , that such an approach always reduces the quality of the archive . In particular , one of the discarded points could be the one that would be selected by the decision maker if the full archive was known .
o	This establishes a connection to related formulations for diffeomorphic image registration <TARGET_CIT> ; an <MATH> -norm is the paramount model in many algorithms ( or its approximation via its Green 's function ; a Gaussian kernel ) Beg:2005a . <REMARK> .
o	The <MATH> -GLMB - GOM filter refr : <TARGET_CIT> is essentially derived by approximating the multi - object posterior as a principled <MATH> -GLMB density and assuming the <MATH> -GLMB prior .
o	Unfortunately and contrary to the complex case , some defects appear : classic Nullstellensatz and theorems A and B of Cartan are no longer valid <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Crucial to understanding this structure is the notion of a primitive form , which directly generalises the classical definition of a primitive form <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Knowledge of the the ground state energy provides us with access to the chemical potential <MATH> and the speed of sound obtained through the compressibility <TARGET_CIT> <MATH> .
o	In particular , for <MATH> we have that <MATH> , since the Motzkin polynomial is a SONC polynomial ; see Section SubSec : PrelimSONC and also Iliman : deWolff : <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Since the calculus for behaviours on the Henson graphs is the same as that on the random graph , the same proof as in BodPin - <TARGET_CIT> works .
o	In contrast with the previous examples , <TARGET_CIT> suggest to select <MATH> by using a deterministic approach , in order to achieve a better accuracy , with respect to the random sampling with respect to <MATH> .
o	This notion was invented by Kaimanovich in <TARGET_CIT> , where the last condition in eq1.5 was replaced by <MATH> .
o	Segment - based stereo <TARGET_CIT> that represents disparity maps by disparity plane segments , could ease the bias issue but recovered surfaces are constrained to be piecewise planar .
o	Patience rules We introduce some terminology for predicates on arguments of function symbols from <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Further exploration placed the problem on nBPA even in <MATH> DBLP : journals / tcs / HirshfeldJM96 ( this problem is thus <MATH> -complete DBLP : journals / fac / <TARGET_CIT> ) ; we can refer to CzerwinskiThesis for further references and a way towards the so far best known upper bound .
o	If <MATH> is a standard Borel space , then <MATH> is also naturally equipped with a standard Borel structure.(One way to see this is to notice that if <MATH> is a compatible Polish topology on <MATH> , then <MATH> is a Borel subset of <MATH> , the Polish space of all compact subsets of <MATH> equipped with the Vietoris topology <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Motivated by this fact , <TARGET_CIT> suggest using mixture of product distributions to improve the simple variational mean - field approximation .
o	To prove threshold saturation we use the proof technique based on potential functions introduced in <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Talking about the known methods for solving BVPs , it is impossible not to mention the simple shooting method ( SSM ) and the multiple shooting method ( MSM ) <TARGET_CIT> which are two the most simple and reliable techniques to deal with boundary value problems of type first_eq , boundary_cond .
o	<MATH> Existence of a unique solution <MATH> to the mixed problem dualvi and equivalence between formulations primalvi and dualvi has been proven , e.g. , in Haslinger et al . <TARGET_CIT> .
o	The proof of the theorem shows that to obtain an affirmative answer to this question it would be enough to show that for a fixed choice of set <MATH> , the KPZ formula of rhodes - vargas - log - kpz ( c.f . ghm - <TARGET_CIT> ) holds simultaneously a.s .
o	We change the setup of zastava accordingly : now <MATH> stands for the zastava space of the affine group <MATH> , denoted by <MATH> in <TARGET_CIT> , and <MATH> stands for its open subscheme denoted by <MATH> in BFG : it is formed by all the points of <MATH> with defects allowed only in the open subset <MATH> .
o	The final claim in the corollary follows immediately from the Martingale Convergence Theorem <TARGET_CIT> .
o	The Kolmogorov <MATH> -width can be rigorously defined , e.g. , for nonlinear functionals in Hilbert spaces ( <TARGET_CIT> , Ch . 4 )
o	<MATH> is proved by pseudolocality , see <TARGET_CIT> .
o	This is what we call a dilation of a partial representation and it leads to a functor from the category of partial <MATH> -modules to the category of <MATH> -modules with projections <TARGET_CIT> .
o	rmkholomorphic_symplectic_form It is well known that every Kummer surface <MATH> is Calabi - Yau ( see Barth_Peters_Van de <TARGET_CIT> ) , which means that its canonical line bundle <MATH> is holomorphically trivial .
o	The sufficient condition described in Proposition IdenCon is a standard identifiability assumption , sometimes referred as the full - rank monitoring assumption in the reputations literature , see for example <TARGET_CIT> .
o	We solve for a stationary velocity field <MATH> and a mass source <MATH> as follows <TARGET_CIT> : subequations e : ip <MATH> .
o	Indeed , even if we were to consider <MATH> in place of <MATH> , the results in <TARGET_CIT> could be used to derive the bound E E(f_R ) - E(f^ * _ _ ) Rn + RM + A(R ) , where <MATH> and <MATH> is a minimizer of the expected risk on <MATH> .
o	Then <MATH> and <MATH> is a translation of some abelian subvariety <MATH> of <MATH> ( cf . <TARGET_CIT> )
o	<TARGET_CIT> ( kawaguchi2017generalization ) took a different approach and claimed that deep neural networks can generalize well despite nonrobustness . However , our definition of ensemble robustness together with our empirical findings suggest that deep learning methods are typically robust although being fragile to adversarial examples .
o	Congruence modular varieties have been thoroughly investigated , and they have many nice properties , nevertheless we need only the definition and the following Mal'cev characterization of these varieties by A. Day <TARGET_CIT> : <THEOREM> .
n	However , key differences render our understanding of the strategies in <TARGET_CIT> to be suggestive at best . These differences include the three - dimensional nature of their strategies versus the two - dimensional nature of our analysis . Furthermore , it is not clear whether the magnitude of bound vorticity induced by changing yaw and pitch of axial flow turbines or the angular speed of cross - flow turbines is adequately strong , and requires additional investigation .
o	We define first - order formulae over <MATH> as usual ( see , , <TARGET_CIT> )
o	Due to the geometric assumptions Hyp : Inj and Hyp : Curv in Theorem Thm : MainApp , the argument to prove the assertion proceeds exactly as Proposition 3.2 in <TARGET_CIT> , which is a version of this result for functions .
o	In faster - <TARGET_CIT> the greedy removal procedure in Figure alg : greedy is applied to the entire design set <MATH> , which gives approximation guarantee <MATH> .
o	However , the Riesz topology is a preferred alternative since it better connects to topological and <MATH> -theoretic aspects of the spectral flow that were observed in <TARGET_CIT> for bounded operators .
o	The construction in denittis - <TARGET_CIT> allows us to define the locally trivial fiber bundle <MATH> SU(E_1,E_2,):=_xX_x : E_1_xE_2_x aligned & vector bundle isomorphism
o	Comparison against closed - form evaluation of <MATH> : average time to compute <MATH> with high precision v.s . <MATH> , comparing the gradient - based estimator from MOE - qEI using a large number of samples ( <MATH> ) in a parallel GPU implementation with the closed - form formula from <TARGET_CIT> .
o	For a proof of , we refer to the book of Maz'ya <TARGET_CIT> , p 641 .
n	This made use not only of the methods from <TARGET_CIT> described above , but also of stopping time arguments for Carleson measures from the solution of the Kato square root problem by Auscher , Hofmann , Lacey , McIntosh and Tchamitchian <TARGET_CIT> . These techniques give results for perturbations when the domains of the Hodge - Dirac operators change , that is when no Lipschitz control of the metric is assumed , and even give holomorphic dependence of <MATH> on the metric <MATH> and not only Lipschitz dependence . However , there are also reasons to prefer the softer methods used in this paper and to avoid the stopping time arguments .
o	These results can be applied to two distinct versions of relative Voevodsky motives ( to the Beilinson motives introduced in cd and to the <MATH> -motives of <TARGET_CIT> ) as well as to certain categories of <MATH> -modules .
o	By <TARGET_CIT> of Orbanz and Szegedy , there exists a measurable map <MATH> which is a section ( one - sided inverse ) of the canonical quotient map <MATH> .
o	Koch <TARGET_CIT> studied the maps <MATH> as meromorphic self - maps of <MATH> , another compactification of <MATH> . Koch found that if ( item : KC1 ) and ( item : KC2 ) hold , and , in addition , the special point <MATH> is fixed by <MATH> , i.e. <MATH> is a topological polynomial , then <MATH> is holomorphic , given in coordinates by homogeneous polynomials of degree equal to the topological degree of <MATH> . Thus if <MATH> is a topological polynomial , <MATH> .
o	In most applications , one may assume that each bad event <MATH> is an open subset of <MATH> and obtain infinitary analogs of the LLL through standard compactness arguments ( see , e.g. , <TARGET_CIT> )
o	Two sets of invariants determine the same Seifert fiber space , if and only if they are related as described in <TARGET_CIT> .
o	The proof for LASSO ( <MATH> ) has been shown in <TARGET_CIT> .
o	These domain walls , if stable on cosmological time scales , will be in conflict with the observed Universe <TARGET_CIT> .
o	We recall a random construction from <TARGET_CIT> which shows that <MATH> .
n	2 ) This optimality and spatial propagation allow randomized search , rather than employ external methods to generate plausible initial proposals as done in fusion approaches <TARGET_CIT> , which may limit the possible solutions .
p	For <MATH> this is a celebrated result by Ivrii <TARGET_CIT> which holds under the assumption that the set of periodic billiards has measure zero .
o	These graphs have previously been studied in the context of well - quasi - order by Lozin and Mayhill lozin : canonical - <TARGET_CIT> , although we do not require their results here .
o	The computation of eigenvalues of symmetric matrices is discussed thoroughly in the monograph by Parlett <TARGET_CIT> .
o	YGinteractingBethe ansatz equations in exponential form The Bethe - ansatz solution of the Yang - Gaudin model Ham consists of superpositions of plane waves for the many - body wave function <TARGET_CIT> .
p	Our integration map ( and the resulting identities ) are essentially the same as the map used by Nagao , which was introduced by Kontsevich and Soibelman in their work on motivic Donaldson - Thomas invariants and Hall algebras <TARGET_CIT> . The benefit of working with these mixed Hodge modules , which provide a categorification of the motivic Hall algebra , is that we can make use of powerful results from Saito 's theory of mixed Hodge modules Sai89 .
o	We note that this also follows directly from the computation of the local coefficient for <MATH> in <TARGET_CIT> .
n	Lebeau <TARGET_CIT> managed to use microlocal defect measures ( which is due to Gerard Gerard - <TARGET_CIT> and Tartar Tartar - H - <TARGET_CIT> , see also Burq - <TARGET_CIT> ) and an argument by contradiction to give a new and much simpler proof . However , when <MATH> , it remains an open problem to give an equivalent condition for strong stabilization , even though the following necessary condition and sufficient condition are known to be classical , which follow by analyzing the proof of Theorem .
p	Soon after , papadimitriou05_ce took a radically different approach to the problem , and surprised the community with an efficient algorithm for computing CE not only in graphical games , but also in almost all known compactly representable games . Jiang2015347 built upon papadimitriou05_ce 's idea to provide what most people would consider an improved polynomial - time algorithm , because of the simplification of the CE that their algorithm outputs ( see also DBLP : journals / sigecom/ <TARGET_CIT> , for a summary )
o	The tori <MATH> appears as fibres of a singular Lagrangian fibration analogous to the one described in <TARGET_CIT> .
o	The following is a generalization of Mukai - <TARGET_CIT> , in which , it was assumed that <MATH> , <MATH> is smooth and irreducible with negative self - intersection number <MATH> on <MATH> , and furthermore , <MATH> was assumed to be a <MATH> -curve on <MATH> ( i.e. <MATH> and <MATH> ) in its application .
o	Following Baez and Lauda <TARGET_CIT> we distinguish strict 2-groups ( where <MATH> and <MATH> ) , coherent 2-groups ( where the global quasiinverse <MATH> exists ) and weak 2-groups ( where there is not necessarily a global inverse )
o	In the control literature , many different families of control variations have been introduced for studying small - time local controllability of systems ( cf . AJK:1977 , sus1987 , <TARGET_CIT> , <TARGET_CIT> , <TARGET_CIT> , COA - <TARGET_CIT> )
o	See the first term in <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Low - density parity - check ( LDPC ) convolutional codes <TARGET_CIT> , also known as spatially coupled LDPC ( SC - LDPC ) codes <TARGET_CIT> , can be obtained from a sequence of individual LDPC block codes by distributing the edges of their Tanner graphs over several adjacent blocks <TARGET_CIT> .
o	By classical Schauder estimates ( see <TARGET_CIT> ) , using the fact that <MATH> solves the equation <MATH> , there exists a constant <MATH> such that <MATH> u_n_C^2(B_0(0,R2))c u_n_C^0(B_0(0,R ) ) , <MATH> for every <MATH> .
o	The magnetic field used to engineer the potential required in each of the steps of the protocol will be created by 4 parallel wires <TARGET_CIT> .
n	The Conversion Theorem of <TARGET_CIT> directly translates algorithms implemented in a CONGEST message passing model to the <MATH> -machine model and almost all the previous algorithms <TARGET_CIT> were derived using this theorem . In contrast , the present paper does not use the Conversion Theorem ; instead , it gives direct solutions for the problems at hand in the <MATH> -machine model , leading to improved algorithms with significantly better round complexity .
o	In fact , the ability to recover Hawking radiation could even be taken as a theoretical test of prospective theories of quantum gravity , much like recovery of the Bekenstein - Hawking formula for black hole entropy <TARGET_CIT> .
o	The following lemma establishes the atomic decomposition of <MATH> , which is a slight variant of <TARGET_CIT> ( see also <TARGET_CIT> )

p	The point of view of crossed products by partial actions of groups was enormously successful for classifying <MATH> -algebras , the most relevant examples are the Bunce - Deddens algebras <TARGET_CIT> , approximately finite dimensional algebras <TARGET_CIT> and the Cuntz - Krieger algebras <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Exactly whether or not this solution can outperform ground station - reliant networks can be assessed using analysis of random geometric networks <TARGET_CIT> .
o	For example , for the problem of triangle enumeration , even assuming the highest possible message lower bound of <MATH> , ( Note that the problem can be trivially solved in <MATH> messages ; see also <TARGET_CIT> where a <MATH> message lower bound is shown for triangle detection in the edge partition model using communication complexity techniques . ) this would directly imply a round lower bound of <MATH> ( since <MATH> messages can be exchanged in one round ) and not the tight <MATH> shown in this paper .
n	For example , the Pareto local search ( PLS ) method <TARGET_CIT> works directly with the Pareto archive and searches neighborhood of each solution from the archive . In such methods , computation of the Pareto archive can not be postponed till the end of the algorithm .
o	The results on stable recovery of sparse vectors were extended to the case of low - rank matrices <TARGET_CIT> , guaranteeing the recovery of <MATH> matrices of rank- <MATH> from <MATH> linear measurements .
o	This is the construction that underlies the Lie construction in <TARGET_CIT> : i.e. decorate every vertex of a graph with an element of cyclic Lie .
o	By extending the class of Leavitt path algebras for which <MATH> provides a complete classification , this result widens the class of algebras for which the Classification Conjectures from <TARGET_CIT> hold .

o	A few years after the bilinear results , Bennett , Carbery , and Tao <TARGET_CIT> proved a sharp <MATH> -linear estimate for <MATH> . <THEOREM> .
o	As the dimension <MATH> of the Coulomb branch vev increases , such searches rapidly become calculationally intractable <TARGET_CIT> , and in many cases we were not able to uncover any solutions by this direct method . However , a less direct approach using known properties of the maximal deformations of the Kodaira singularities yields an easy existence proof and straightforward construction of curves realizing each of the allowed deformation patterns in table table : theories .
o	Therefore , we envision our solution can be rapidly deployed in public clouds as a new security service to customers who require higher security assurances ( like in Security - on - Demand clouds <TARGET_CIT> )

o	Moreover , generic metrizable projective structure has only one , up to a scaling , metric in the projective class ( see e.g. <TARGET_CIT> )
o	In order to increase this speed , in step 2 ( boost ) the center - of - mass evolves in an inverted harmonic potential of frequency <MATH> <TARGET_CIT> , given by the Hamiltonian <MATH> , from <MATH> to <MATH> such that <MATH> is boosted by a factor of <MATH> .

p	Dujmovic , Joret , Kozik , and Wood <TARGET_CIT> managed to decrease the value of the aforementioned constant <MATH> dramatically using the entropy compression method . Namely , they lowered the constant to <MATH> , or , to be precise , they showed that <MATH> ( assuming <MATH> )
o	Locally , it is a special case of what was done in Levi - <TARGET_CIT> , we recall it for the convenience of the reader .
o	Then , a result of Schutt <TARGET_CIT> implies that <MATH> has a model(More generally it has a model over the field <MATH> , which does not always coincide with the ring class field <MATH> .
o	A basic result in signed graph theory is that <MATH> can be equivalently defined as the minimum number of arcs whose deletion in <MATH> yield a balanced signed digraph <TARGET_CIT> .
o	To represent the high - dimensional ( complex - valued ) function <MATH> one can use techniques such as HDMR ( Section sec : HDMR ) , functional tensor methods ( Section sec : tensor ) , or sparse collocation <TARGET_CIT> .
o	By <TARGET_CIT> , the quotient <MATH> is universally a geometric quotient .

o	By <TARGET_CIT> , the quotient <MATH> .
o	Here we recover by means of Corollary corextremal a criterion due to Kleinbock , Margulis and Wang kleinbock - margulis - <TARGET_CIT> for the extremality of measures on two - by - two matrices .
o	In fact , It is shown in <TARGET_CIT> that the classical results of Hopf - Galois theory and its relation to Morita theory are <MATH>.
o	We use a GC implementation of <TARGET_CIT> .
o	For instance , they have unbounded VC - dimension while simple polygons have bounded VC - dimension <TARGET_CIT> .
o	The systems proposed in <TARGET_CIT> were generalizations of the six - vertex model .
o	In describing this construction , we rely on the prior work and notation of McNamara in <TARGET_CIT> and <TARGET_CIT> , building on the foundational papers of Matsumoto <TARGET_CIT> and Kazhdan - Patterson <TARGET_CIT> .
o	The analysis of networked control systems has received considerable attention in the recent past <TARGET_CIT> and our goal will be to reappraise methods and tools developed within this area in the context of microgrids .
o	This idea dates back to Lamport <TARGET_CIT> , and similar technique has been used in different contexts : for synchronous systems <TARGET_CIT> and for asynchronous systems <TARGET_CIT> .
o	By <TARGET_CIT> , one has <MATH> .
o	For the example of the partial action of <MATH> on the complex plane by Mobius transformations , Kellendonk and Lawson proved that the globalized space with its quotient topology coincides with the one point compactification of the complex plane , the Riemann sphere <TARGET_CIT> , as anyone could expect .
o	It also appears in Croke and Kleiner 's paper on rigidity of warped products ( <TARGET_CIT> ) , in Theorem 1.7.1 of <TARGET_CIT> , and in Theorem H of <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Generic Observation Model The standard formulation in the RFS based multi - object tracking is based on the standard observation model refr : <TARGET_CIT> where observation data is assumed to have been preprocessed into thresholded detections , each object is assumed to cause at most one detection , and each detection is assumed to be either a false alarm ( clutter ) or generated from one object .

o	<TARGET_CIT> implement a clustering proposal which cumulatively adds observation branches ( as shown in Figure ) to clusters by starting with empty clusters with mean and variance equal to their corresponding prior means . As each observation branch is added to one of the clusters ( in random order ) , the means and variances of that cluster are updated according to the corresponding posterior means . This allows the sampler to propose clusters for each branch according to the cluster in which it fits best , while randomising the order of the allocation meant that no branches were given higher weight than others .

o	First , conventional methods to estimate the transition matrix of a VAR model are based on the least squares ( LS ) estimator and the maximum likelihood estimator ( MLE ) , in which the parameter estimation is consistent when the sample size increases and the model size is fixed brockwelldavis1991 . Since the number of parameters grows quadratically in the number of time series variables , the VAR model typically includes no more than ten variables in many real applications <TARGET_CIT> . However , due to the recent explosive data enrichment , analysis of panel data with a few hundred variables is often encountered , in which the LS and MLE are not suitable even for a moderate problem size . Second , stationarity plays a major role in the VAR model . Therefore , the stationary VAR does not capture the time - varying underlying data generation structures , which have been observed in a broad regime of applications in economics and finance angpiazzesi2003 .

p	Another form to overcome the non - Hausdorffness of the globalized space is to consider the groupoid of the equivalence relation as a subset of <MATH> instead of considering the quotient <MATH> <TARGET_CIT> . This approach has some advantages , but it requires some techniques coming from groupoids in order to analyse the globalization . For the case of partial actions of groups on algebras , Definition globset of a globalization needs some modifications .

o	One can show ( cf . <TARGET_CIT> ) that , for <MATH> , we have <MATH> .

o	In multi - round systems , the dynamics of a system can even be certified without the need for any quantum mechanical capacities <TARGET_CIT> .
o	We then obtain a similar complexity dichotomy for reducts of homogeneous equivalence relations , expanding earlier results for special cases equiv - <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Obtaining stresses , strains or energies / energy densities is even more difficult and can usually only be done through post - processing of CT data or by means of digital image correlation of specimen surface images ( see e.g. bart - <TARGET_CIT> )
o	All spectra will also be available through WISeREP(http://wiserep.weizmann.ac.il / home ) <TARGET_CIT> .
o	These domain walls , if stable on cosmological time scales , will be in conflict with the observed Universe <TARGET_CIT> .
p	The best known upper bound on <MATH> is <MATH> due to Kramer , Martin and Young <TARGET_CIT> .
p	In parallel , Hinton:1993 proposed a variational algorithm for a similar neural network model . <TARGET_CIT> ( first published in 1993 ) made important connections to the EM algorithm <TARGET_CIT> , which then led to a variety of variational inference algorithms for other types of models Waterhouse:1996 .
o	This quantity is defined by <TARGET_CIT> <MATH> .
o	More recent works provided extensions of the above results to diffusive settings in BenthReikvam and <TARGET_CIT> , to Brownian two - dimensional problems with state constraints in <TARGET_CIT> , to Ito - Levy dynamics under partial information in <TARGET_CIT> , and to non - Markovian processes in <TARGET_CIT> .

o	The lower exponent- <MATH> central series(Properties of this series are given in Huppert and Blackburn <TARGET_CIT> . However , their definition differs from ours as it starts with <MATH> .
o	While we have focused on this paradigmatic parameter - free collapse model as a figure of merit , we remark that our proposal would falsify the continuous - spontaneous - localization collapse model <TARGET_CIT> with a collapse frequency phenomenological parameter as small as <MATH> , several orders of magnitude below the original value proposed by Ghirardi , Rimini , and Weber in the 80 's <TARGET_CIT> .
o	More precisely , for any commutative ring <MATH> , we define a cochain complex endowed with a cup product , <MATH> , whose homology in perversity <MATH> is denoted <MATH> and called blown - up intersection cohomology ( or Thom - Whitney cohomology in some previous works , <TARGET_CIT> , <TARGET_CIT> , <TARGET_CIT> , <TARGET_CIT> )
o	The construction of a natural extension has been detailed in <TARGET_CIT> and we state the result .
n	Our results are quite contradictory to the results reported in Zhou2017 where DDA - NS is the fastest algorithm in most cases . Please note , however , that in <TARGET_CIT> the algorithms were implemented in MATLAB which , as the authors note , is very efficient in matrix operations . On the other hand , the CPU times reported in Zhou2017 are of orders of magnitude higher compared to our experiment which suggests rather that the MATLAB implementation of M - Front and ENS - BS / SS is quite inefficient .
o	A symmetric motif is a potentially disconnected subset of vertices with the property that any permutation of indices preserves adjacency <TARGET_CIT> .
p	Accumulating from the works of Gelfand , Berenstein and Zelevinsky since 1970 's , a first quite satisfying model for <MATH> of type <MATH> was invented in <TARGET_CIT> .

o	At this stage , we have obtained objects - and a few estimates about them - that will allow us to complete our proof as in the last two paragraphs of the proof of <TARGET_CIT> 4.1]dinh : sammcl05 .
o	It has been developed for the same class of models described here <TARGET_CIT> .
o	In this particular case the theorem corresponds to lemma 3.8 of <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Instead , a solitonic vortex brand01a was observed <TARGET_CIT> , that owes its large mass ratio <MATH> ( in the hundreds ) to hydrodynamic effects Ku2014 .
o	Consequently , by the result of Lee <TARGET_CIT> mentioned above , <MATH> has a dominating set <MATH> of size at most <MATH> .
o	The time is in the the units of the interaction strength <MATH> <TARGET_CIT> .
o	We begin with a gentle reminder on the deformation theory of maps ( c.f . Section 3.4 of <TARGET_CIT> ) : If <MATH> is an unramified morphism between lci schemes , then first - order deformations of <MATH> and obstructions to lifting them lie in the cohomology groups <MATH> and <MATH> respectively of the normal bundle :
o	The data points are from the gold and Silver SNe Ia of <TARGET_CIT> .

p	The point of view of crossed products by partial actions of groups was enormously successful for classifying <MATH> -algebras , the most relevant examples are the Bunce - Deddens algebras <TARGET_CIT> , approximately finite dimensional algebras <TARGET_CIT> and the Cuntz - Krieger algebras <TARGET_CIT> .
o	In RRS - <TARGET_CIT> we establish a weaker version of Conjecture conj1 .
o	The estimates obtained in Theorem mainstabthm , in particular the uniform bound uniformbound for <MATH> and and the uniform decay udecayestimate , are the crucial preliminary results that are required to extend the stability results obtained in the acoustic case , in <TARGET_CIT> for sound - soft scatterers and in <TARGET_CIT> for sound - hard scatterers , to the electromagnetic case .
o	We use the ( formal ) Lagrangian method <TARGET_CIT> to solve e : varopt ; the Lagrangian functional <MATH> is given by <MATH> .
o	We begin by recalling several definitions from <TARGET_CIT> and <TARGET_CIT> .
o	The second Chern class of <MATH> is <MATH> ( see denittis - <TARGET_CIT> ) and consequently one has <MATH> ( E_Hopf)=(-1)^c_2(E_Hopf)=-1 .
o	By <TARGET_CIT> , the definition of <MATH> -large is independent of the choice of tori <MATH> .
o	This notion was introduced , using slightly different words , by Beresnevich , Kleinbock and Margulis beresnevich - kleinbock - <TARGET_CIT> who showed that every locally good weakly non - planar measure on <MATH> is extremal .
o	Following van - den - <TARGET_CIT> , we choose the bias fluxes such that , < NEW_LINE>. <MATH> .
o	This corresponds to dropping all expressions with <MATH> in e : hessian - matvec and e : inc - adj - pde - elim ( see <TARGET_CIT> for more details ) ; we recover quadratic convergence for <MATH> .
o	In particular for the choice <MATH> gives the <MATH> model on networks , which has originated from Social Sciences and has been studied in Statistics(c.f . <TARGET_CIT> , <TARGET_CIT> and references there - in )
o	One subgradient approach based algorithm is proposed to solve the maxmin problem in WPCNs with RF energy harvesting nodes only in <TARGET_CIT> .
o	In this case , <MATH> is assumed to be a positive definite function <TARGET_CIT> and it is shown that choosing the centers to be the input points , hence <MATH> , suffices for optimal statistical results kimeldorf1970correspondence .
o	The bound <MATH> is rather weak ; in fact , Brooks 's theorem in finite combinatorics asserts that <MATH> for all <MATH> apart from a few natural exceptions <TARGET_CIT> .
o	The reason is mostly that some character and Brauer tables are known but not yet available in the Character table library of GAP <TARGET_CIT> or the GAP Atlas of Group Representations <TARGET_CIT> or that the package <TARGET_CIT> can not solve the underlying inequalities .
o	Using these basic results , we give proofs of a few extreme value properties , following closely <TARGET_CIT> .
o	This line of thought was greatly extended in <TARGET_CIT> , which introduces Morita equivalence for quasi - symplectic groupoids ( or twisted presymplectic groupoids in the sense of <TARGET_CIT> ) , which plays an analogous role for twisted Dirac manifolds as Morita equivalence of symplectic groupoids in Poisson geometry .
o	In <TARGET_CIT> the authors defined a tilting module <MATH> in <MATH> ( it is denoted by <MATH> in GLSa ) . They proved that the quiver of the endomorphism algebra <MATH> is exactly <MATH> with its frozen vertices of corresponding to the projective - injective objects in <MATH> .

o	We refer the reader to <TARGET_CIT> for the definition .
o	But precisely these singularities were ruled out of physical deformation patterns by the safely irrelevant conjecture , as argued in <TARGET_CIT> .
p	Its structure is sufficiently constraining that it forced theorists to predict the existence of the Higgs boson <TARGET_CIT> five decades before its spectacular discovery in 2012 <TARGET_CIT> .
o	It is well known ( see , e.g. , <TARGET_CIT> ) that <MATH> , and hence the <MATH> -th record <MATH> of the sequence is well defined : <MATH> , <MATH> .
o	First , conventional methods to estimate the transition matrix of a VAR model are based on the least squares ( LS ) estimator and the maximum likelihood estimator ( MLE ) , in which the parameter estimation is consistent when the sample size increases and the model size is fixed <TARGET_CIT> .

o	While homogeneous relational structures are abundant , there are remarkably few countably infinite homogeneous ( undirected , irreflexive ) graphs ; they have been classified by Lachlan and Woodrow <TARGET_CIT> .
o	A cell - wise procedure , e.g. by dividing each Voronoi cell individually into triangles as proposed by <TARGET_CIT> and shown in fig : hom_schemes works well for strain mappings , but is not suited for stress continuization since it is not clear how to evaluate without ambiguity force couples acting on the control volumes from the forces acting on the junction points .
o	We obtain ( eq : conn_key_bound_aux1 ) upon using ( eq : app_b_new2 ) in ( eq : app_b_new1 ) and noting by Cayley 's formula <TARGET_CIT> that there are <MATH> trees on <MATH> vertices , i.e. , <MATH> .
o	The effective particle number <MATH> ( called <MATH> in <TARGET_CIT> ) is closely related to the number of atoms <MATH> in the dark soliton , i.e. the number of atoms that have to be removed from the background density to create an observed density depression .
o	This lower bound coincides with the lower bounds identified by Fudenberg and Levine <TARGET_CIT> and Gossner <TARGET_CIT> as the long - lived player becomes arbitrarily patient , i.e. , as the discount factor tends to 1 .
o	Recent reviews of colloid fabrication are available in the literature <TARGET_CIT> ; in this Review we focus on crystal assembly <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Hence , no amplification of local rounding errors occurs in classical CG , since eq : gap_f0_cg indicates that local rounding errors are simply accumulated , see also <TARGET_CIT> .
o	And in the counterexample from <TARGET_CIT> or <TARGET_CIT> , there is a low - degree variety <MATH> whose <MATH> -neighborhood contains one such curved tube for every <MATH> .
o	Here is the key Lemma in <TARGET_CIT> .
o	We also show that our results for triangle enumeration imply new bounds for the well - studied congested clique model <TARGET_CIT> .
o	One of the main results of dinhSibony : <TARGET_CIT> , applied to the setting of compact Riemann surfaces , states that when <MATH> , there exist a polar set <MATH> and a regular Borel probability measure <MATH> such that <MATH> .
p	Our main result concerns one of the possible Dirac - theoretic(Since the inception of Dirac geometry in the work of T. Courant <TARGET_CIT> , many people worked on the field , and there are several good sources available .
o	The problem is ubiquitous in apportionment settings such as proportional representation of seats in the U.S. congress , European Parliament , and the German Bundestag as well as various other committee selection settings <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Novikov <TARGET_CIT> and most of the authors Pa regard Novikov homology as a <MATH> vector space , where <MATH> denotes the field of Laurent power series with coefficients in <MATH> obtained by extending the scalars from <MATH> to <MATH>
o	By <TARGET_CIT> , we may choose <MATH> such that over <MATH> , all fibers of these group schemes are smooth , connected , and reductive .
o	For an analysis of the involved properties in this setting see <TARGET_CIT> .
o	We refer for the Fourier analytic details used in this article to stein : <TARGET_CIT> and for a survey on random distributions to <TARGET_CIT> .
o	The use of such quadratic estimates to bound functional calculi goes back to the work of Coifman , McIntosh and Meyer <TARGET_CIT> on Calderon 's problem on the boundedness of the Cauchy integral of Lipschitz curves .
o	To compare optimization approaches of ours and <TARGET_CIT> , we replace the data term of <TARGET_CIT> with ours so that the two methods use the same energy function as ours .
o	To address this , simulation - based statistical methods based on coalescent models for parameter estimation have emerged giving rise to statistical phylogeography <TARGET_CIT> allowing for testing among competing demographic models .
o	Nevertheless , it does not exclude the possibility that the holonomy of the complex hyperbolic structure is a lattice in <MATH> , as both Mostow and Sauter showed that it can happen when <MATH> ( see <TARGET_CIT> )
o	We investigate two conservation scenarios : antenna conservation , where the number of antennas is kept equal , and RF chain conservation , where the number of RF chains is kept equal <TARGET_CIT> .
o	There are various rigorous versions of this formula using different notions of dimension ; see aru - <TARGET_CIT> .
o	The result of Theorem surface_case was already achieved by Fujiki <TARGET_CIT> with different methods , see also <TARGET_CIT> for a study in the case where <MATH> is prime .

o	The ADE go through a the difficulty to characterize the matter dominated era <TARGET_CIT> while the NADE resolved this subject <TARGET_CIT> .
o	An easy observation is the following lemma ( cf . Cpl - Ab - <TARGET_CIT> )
o	This fact was also observed by the authors of Garcia - <TARGET_CIT> where they found that a low mass right fermion triplet dark matter mass below 1 TeV is still consistent with indirect detection constraints .
o	The operators <MATH> and <MATH> refer to the bosonic creation and annihilation operators for the medium - assisted field that follow canonical commutation relations , and the coefficients <MATH> are defined as G_e , i^2c^2 _ 0[G , G_m , i^2c^2 _ 0[]G , with <MATH> and <MATH> as the space - dependent permittivity and permeability , and <MATH> as the Green 's tensor for a particle near a planar semi - infinite surface <TARGET_CIT> .
o	<MATH> This fact is a consequence of the compactness of the embedding <MATH> ( see the book of Maz'ya <TARGET_CIT> or DiNezza - Palatucci - <TARGET_CIT> for a direct proof )
o	The AC FD scenario is motivated by the recent FD implementations <TARGET_CIT> ; the notion of keeping the number of RF chains equal is also reasonable from a practical perspective , since RF chains are the components that dominantly increase the total cost of a radio <TARGET_CIT> .
o	As already mentioned , the finite - dimensional Fisher - Rao geometry studied in sec : fisher_rao naturally extends to infinite - dimensions ( see <TARGET_CIT> )
o	Previous primary controllers of DGUs 4 and 5 still fulfill the plug - in conditions in <TARGET_CIT> : they are therefore maintained and the plug - in of DGU 7 is performed .
o	The general solution decaying at infinity can be written as a linear combination of the Kelvin functions <MATH> and <MATH> <TARGET_CIT> .
o	In addition , while the ordered eigenvalues of <MATH> are no longer nonnegative , their interpretation as graph frequencies which order the corresponding eigenvectors in terms of the number of their oscillations ( zero crossings ) <TARGET_CIT> remains valid , with the only difference that the graph frequency <MATH> of <MATH> becomes the new zero or DC - frequency in <MATH> .
o	In the analytic context , from the Darboux - Cartan theorem <TARGET_CIT> , a <MATH> -parallelized complex manifold <MATH> has a natural <MATH> structure where <MATH> is a Lie group with <MATH> .
o	The number of cubic bipartite graphs with order <MATH> is given as <MATH> in a recent study by Brinkmann et al . 2013 <TARGET_CIT> .
o	For geometric structures modeled on a ( possibly indefinite ) complex hyperbolic space <MATH> , this coincides with the fact of being geodesically complete for the associated Levi - Civita connection ( see Proposition 1.2 of <TARGET_CIT> for instance )
o	with <MATH> the essential Chow motive of <MATH> ( see <TARGET_CIT> )
o	Moreover , there are several recent papers dealing with embeddability of graphs associated with algebraic structures on topological surfaces . For instance , see <TARGET_CIT> , <TARGET_CIT> , <TARGET_CIT> , <TARGET_CIT> , raj5 CIT .
p	Later this was generalized by Chen and Li <TARGET_CIT> and recently this general bound was improved by the authors of the present article <TARGET_CIT> .
o	In a non - equilibrium system of particles obeying quantum statistics ( such as fermions ) , the DSF is given by the Fourier transform of the correlation function of density fluctuations <MATH> <TARGET_CIT> <MATH> .
o	Cooling In this step , which takes place from <MATH> to <MATH> , the center - of - mass motion of the microsphere along the <MATH> -axis is cooled using a linear quantum nanomechanical coupling to a cavity mode <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Brav and Joyce BBJ prove the following interesting result : Let <MATH> be a <MATH> -shifted symplectic derived scheme over <MATH> in the sense of <TARGET_CIT> , and let <MATH> be the associated classical <MATH> -scheme of <MATH> .
o	This is an easy consequence of Luna 's slice theorem , see <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Compatibility condition for the maps <MATH> The idea is inspired by a paper of Schutt <TARGET_CIT> : given a singular abelian surface <MATH> , among all decompositions that we can choose , there is one that behaves better that the others , namely the decomposition that Shioda and Mitani used to prove the surjectivity of the period map for singular abelian surfaces shioda - <TARGET_CIT> .
o	The proof is in <TARGET_CIT> ; let us just say that the correspondence <MATH> simply restricts <MATH> to the fiber <MATH> of the projection <MATH> over the object <MATH> .
o	Since then , many other examples have appeared that include classes of 0 - 1 matrices <TARGET_CIT> ; directed graphs by degree sequence <TARGET_CIT> ; eulerian digraphs <TARGET_CIT> ; eulerian circuits <TARGET_CIT> ; types of integer matrices <TARGET_CIT> ; and multiple other problems <TARGET_CIT> .
o	We consider three particular concatenated convolutional coding schemes : Parallel concatenated codes ( PCCs ) <TARGET_CIT> , serially concatenated codes ( SCCs ) <TARGET_CIT> , and braided convolutional codes ( BCCs ) <TARGET_CIT> .
n	However , further work is needed to cover the entire spectrum in <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Again , via Saito 's results , we may alternatively describe <MATH> as the smallest full subcategory , closed under extensions , containing <MATH> for <MATH> an irreducible closed subvariety , and <MATH> a pure variation of Hodge structure on <MATH> , a dense open subvariety of <MATH> , since by <TARGET_CIT> , any such variation of Hodge structure is trivial along the fibres of the projection <MATH> .
o	Let <MATH> be the Duflo involution in <MATH> , see <TARGET_CIT> .
o	This space scale is given by <MATH> where <MATH> represents the root - mean - square velocity of the energy - containing scales <TARGET_CIT> and <MATH> is the meridional derivative of the Coriolis parameter <MATH> .
p	The following theorem , which was proved in <TARGET_CIT> for dimension 2 and in <TARGET_CIT> for dimensions <MATH> ( in fact , in the Riemannian case , <TARGET_CIT> or <TARGET_CIT> are sufficient ) , plays a crucial role .
o	See Proposition 6.5 of <TARGET_CIT> .
o	This also holds for any resolution of <MATH> because <MATH> has only klt and hence rational singularities ( cf . <TARGET_CIT> )
o	That number of iterations is relatively low , but given that our implementation is in MATLAB , setting <MATH> is roughly the number of iterations for which the amount is roughly the same as that for our C implementation of TRW , as described in <TARGET_CIT> , but without optimizing for the parameters <MATH> 's , which we set to a constant <MATH> for all edges <MATH> .
o	In other words , Seifert fiberings on <MATH> are uniquely determined by two coprime positive integers <TARGET_CIT> ( cf . GL16 )
o	If the scalar field <MATH> in this case is non - vanishing then it can be set to a constant by a transformation with <MATH> , in which case the gravitational part of the theory reduces to General Relativity <TARGET_CIT> ; thus <MATH> is ' pure gauge ' whenever it is non - vanishing .
o	<TARGET_CIT> Proposition 0.1.3 )
o	The space <MATH> ( denoted with the symbol <MATH> in denittis - gomi-14 ) coincides with the Brillouin zone of condensed matter systems invariant under <MATH> -translations and subjected to a TRS ( for more details , we refer to denittis - <TARGET_CIT> )
o	The existence of <MATH> products at the cochain level allowed in <TARGET_CIT> an explicit determination of the rank of perversities in the definition of Steenrod intersection squares .
o	Then for any team <MATH> , the probability of team <MATH> defeating team <MATH> would be no less than the probability of team <MATH> defeating team <MATH> , which gives <MATH> Even though the SST condition is classical , a formal study of estimation under this condition was done recently in <TARGET_CIT> and was termed as the Nonparametric Bradley Terry Model .
o	The edge version was first considered by Fiamcik <TARGET_CIT> , and independently by Alon , McDiarmid , and Reed <TARGET_CIT> .
o	The generalisation of this principle , namely that an automorphic form on <MATH> that is orthogonal to theta lifts from <MATH> must have vanishing <MATH> periods , was used by Donnelly <TARGET_CIT> .
o	In order to connect to the existence and uniqueness result in <TARGET_CIT> we need the following .
o	Results in this section follow the approach in <TARGET_CIT> , where stability of consensus is analyzed through the use of invariant subspaces .
o	This has been employed , for instance , by Schutt in the study of the field of definition of singular K3 surfaces <TARGET_CIT> : he proved that a singular K3 surface <MATH> always admits a model over a ring class field <MATH> , <MATH> being the field <MATH> , generalizing previous results of Inose <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Following an argument in Ghasemi : Marshall : GP : <TARGET_CIT> we can assume that all monomial squares of <MATH> are vertices of <MATH> : One can reduce to this case by neglecting all monomial squares not corresponding to such a vertex .
o	The idea is inspired by a very similar approach commonly used with discrete element methods ( see for example <TARGET_CIT> , <TARGET_CIT> , <TARGET_CIT> )
o	This shows that the choice of prior has no impact on the asymptotic optimality of Bayes - UCB , unlike what happens for Thompson Sampling in Gaussian bandit with unknown mean and variance <TARGET_CIT> .
o	These regulators , termed Plug - and - Play ( PnP ) have the following features : ( i ) the existence of a local controller for a DGU can be tested on local hardware , and control design is cast into an optimization problem , ( ii ) each optimization problem exploits information about the DGU only <TARGET_CIT> or , at most , the power lines connected to it <TARGET_CIT> , and ( iii ) when a DGU is plugged - in , no other DGUs <TARGET_CIT> , or at most neighboring DGUs <TARGET_CIT> , must update their local controllers .
o	This determinant construction is a functor from the category of vector spaces to itself and , by a standard argument <TARGET_CIT> , induces a functor on the category of complex vector bundles over an arbitrary space <MATH> .
o	A comprehensive description of this case is carried on in the paper <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Now consider the local conductance constant , defined in <TARGET_CIT> as <MATH> H ( S):= _ SS ( S )
o	Adapting the techniques of <TARGET_CIT> to the present setting we now obtain the following result , corresponding to Theorem C of the introduction .
o	Equation self_energy_hf_fourier represents a further generalization of the finite - wavelength screening wave number discussed in Ref . <TARGET_CIT> .
o	If <MATH> denotes the law of <MATH> , <MATH> and <MATH> is the Laplace functional of <MATH> , then <MATH> is equal to <MATH> where <MATH> thm Assuming the mixing and anticlustering conditions for compactly supported continuous functions , this statement was proved in <TARGET_CIT> .
p	The idea , first introduced by Grytczuk , Kozik , and Micek in their study of nonrepetitive sequences <TARGET_CIT> , is to construct a randomized procedure that solves a given combinatorial problem and then apply the entropy compression argument to show that it runs in expected finite time . A wealth of new results have been obtained using this paradigm ; see e.g. Duj , Esperet , Goncalves .
p	Such formulas are derived using Tropical Geometry <TARGET_CIT> . Their advantage over MT is that they furnish start systems for homotopy continuation in Numerical Algebraic Geometry BHSW .
o	Minimising this using Lagrange multipliers with the Kirchhoff current law as a constraint <TARGET_CIT> , see for example Fig .
o	For these latter case , we borrow and extend ideas from <TARGET_CIT> and more generally from the theory of statical leverage scores journals / jmlr / <TARGET_CIT> .
o	In particular , we obtain the following stronger form of <TARGET_CIT> in which the generalized Gauss map is preserved .
n	The model considered in <TARGET_CIT> also shows a similar behavior . However , no general theory of term structure modelling was available for hybrid models so far .
o	Hence , each user has an allowable amount of energy to be consumed in each slot , <MATH> <TARGET_CIT> .
o	T ' : ( HT ) H^T mapping coalgebras <MATH> to <MATH> and homomorphisms <MATH> to <MATH> ( see e.g. <TARGET_CIT> for a proof )
p	The action of <TARGET_CIT> is more accurate , but our choice makes a couple of equations simpler . Moreover , the difference will only show up at third order in the small parameter <MATH> , and therefore is irrelevant for our present purpose .
o	This result is due to Kleinbock kleinbock - <TARGET_CIT> in the case where <MATH> and <MATH> are norms , and the proof is essentially the same , once the correspondence of subsecdani has been established .
o	The directed graph spline The collective of results pertaining to vanishing moments of graph operators can be extended to the case when <MATH> is the adjacency matrix of a directed circulant graph <MATH> , and the corresponding graph Laplacian is replaced by a first order ( normalized ) difference operator of the form <MATH> , similarly defined as in <TARGET_CIT> .
o	The manner in which this is done has three main sources of inspiration : The first is Majid 's frame bundle approach to noncommutative geometry qqguage which also underpins the author 's earlier papers <TARGET_CIT> .
o	This theorem is due to Kwasnicki <TARGET_CIT> and generalizes an earlier result <TARGET_CIT> for <MATH> .
o	In the context of collective risk theory this hitting time can be interpreted as a ruin time associated to the entrance of <MATH> in the set <MATH> ( see <TARGET_CIT> )
o	That may sound surprising since the SW algorithm is known to mix slowly for the Potts model with <MATH> <TARGET_CIT> , but this is only the case near the transition temperature <MATH> .
o	We have studied the mathematical properties of the Fourier spectrum for symbolic sequences <TARGET_CIT> .
o	The eventual regularity of smooth solution in the spirit of previous works for the supercritical SQG equation , has been obtained by Do in <TARGET_CIT> .
p	To this end , we follow the well established structured argumentation formalism Modgil : <TARGET_CIT> and impose the principle of Contraposition , reformulated for as follows .
o	By <TARGET_CIT> the moduli space of weighted pointed rational curves <MATH> with weights <MATH> can be constructed as the blow - up <MATH> of <MATH> at three general points <MATH> .
o	The spectral sparsification problem where <MATH> can be arbitrarily designed ( i.e. not restricted to have <MATH> diagonal entries ) is completely solved graph - <TARGET_CIT> , where the size of the selected edge subset is allowed to be linear to the number of vertices , or in the terminology of our problem , <MATH> . Unfortunately , both methods require the power of arbitrary designing the weights in <MATH> , which is generally not available in experiment selection problems ( i.e. , can not set noise variance or signal strength arbitrarily for individual design points )
o	However , at least for the case of , some weak interaction is present for the majority of the photospheric evolution in a similar fashion to hat found for same SLSN I <TARGET_CIT> .
p	Also , by the fundamental work of Gromov <TARGET_CIT> and Yomdin Yomdin87 , the ( topological ) entropy of an automorphism <MATH> can be defined as the logarithm of the spectral radius of the pullback action <MATH> on the total cohomology ring <MATH> .
o	Typically this is done iteratively , with an N - body interaction being reduced to a 2-body interaction using a complete graph on <MATH> logical bits and <MATH> ancilla bits Perdomo - <TARGET_CIT> .

p	This is the case because arbitrary local Lindbladian dynamics can be approximated by a poly - length quantum circuit and thus simulated efficiently on a quantum computer Kliesch - <TARGET_CIT> .
o	This method was first applied by Martin in the proof of the well - foundedness of the Wadge hierarchy ( see <TARGET_CIT> )
o	Except the set <MATH> , all of the above cones are proper ( see Section 1.6 of <TARGET_CIT> , where a proper cone is called a full cone ) , and we can easily see from the definitions that the following inclusions hold : <MATH> .

One of these challenges is to develop efficient algorithms for determining whether a given matrix is copositive .
o	Similarly to the above , mapping the identity <MATH> -morphism in <MATH> to any simple object in <MATH> , defines , by the universal property <TARGET_CIT> , a <MATH> -natural transformation from <MATH> to the defining <MATH> -representation of <MATH> ( i.e. the natural <MATH> -action of <MATH> on <MATH> )

o	Based on the result of <TARGET_CIT> ( lemma 1 , page 2 ) , for any <MATH> , there exists <MATH> such that for a positive integer , <MATH> holds : <MATH> .
o	As for the sufficient condition we refer to <TARGET_CIT> or <TARGET_CIT> .
o	This defines a partial action <MATH> of <MATH> on <MATH> , and this action is global if and only if the functor <MATH> is star surjective <TARGET_CIT> .
o	However , we know from <TARGET_CIT> that , for almost every <MATH> -tuple <MATH> , the group <MATH> is isomorphic to <MATH> , so that , if <MATH> denotes the number of elements in the ball of radius <MATH> with respect to the generating set <MATH> , there exist positive constants <MATH> such that <MATH> .

o	Mansour and Vainshtein mansour : <TARGET_CIT> had proved this rationality result for proper subclasses classes defined by a single additional restriction earlier .
o	Thus the " three edge theorem " in RRS - <TARGET_CIT> provides a common generalisation of Mantel 's theorem and Theorem K4- to the context of <MATH> -uniform hypergraphs .
o	Take a <MATH> -equivariant resolution <MATH> ( cf . Hironaka <TARGET_CIT> ) , such that the linear system <MATH> equals <MATH> , where <MATH> is base point free , <MATH> is the fixed component of <MATH> , and both of their divisor classes are <MATH> -stable .

p	The study of variable Lebesgue spaces originated from Orlicz <TARGET_CIT> in 1931 , which were further developed by Nakano <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Now we are facing a difficulty which did not appear in <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Since the projection <MATH> is a Riemannian submersion , it follows from general results in Riemannian geometry ( see <TARGET_CIT> ) that the Hessian of the lifted relative entropy on <MATH> restricted to the horizontal distribution coincide with the Hessian of the relative entropy on <MATH> .
o	Indeed , as it was pointed out in <TARGET_CIT> ( cf . p. 857 ) one may hope to " jump " from one formulation to the other in order to " pose and solve more favourable problems "
o	In particular , from the proof of <TARGET_CIT> , it follows that the following graded <MATH> -bimodules are graded isomorphic for any <MATH> <MATH> .

o	Equivalently , it is essentially due to the fact that the analogous Casselman - Shalika formula for covering groups as in CO and Mc2 is vector - valued , whereas for linear algebraic groups it is scalar - valued ( cf . <TARGET_CIT> )
o	For each weighting , <MATH> , we have a corresponding cellular structure on <MATH> , see <TARGET_CIT> for details .
o	This conjecture was proved by Sprindzuk <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Generic Observation Model The standard formulation in the RFS based multi - object tracking is based on the standard observation model refr : <TARGET_CIT> where observation data is assumed to have been preprocessed into thresholded detections , each object is assumed to cause at most one detection , and each detection is assumed to be either a false alarm ( clutter ) or generated from one object .
o	For <MATH> , let <MATH> be the change in the right boundary length of <MATH> between time <MATH> and time <MATH> , as in <TARGET_CIT> .
o	This lower bound implies Theorem AB for it is well - known that a real number generated by a finite automaton has factor complexity in <MATH> <TARGET_CIT> .

o	The conclusion of Theorem T : rep - fixpts_corr does not require one of the hypotheses - which , designated as ( H4 ) , concerns a certain measure supported on the postcritical set ( we will not explicitly need the definition of this set here)-of <TARGET_CIT> 4.1]dinh : sammcl05 .
o	Considering perturbations <MATH> of <MATH> with <MATH> , a necessary condition for an extremum <MATH> of a functional <MATH> is that its first variation <MATH> vanishes at <MATH> , see <TARGET_CIT> .
o	However , as the indexing of Whittaker functionals also differs from ours by taking an " inverse " , thus our terminology is different but equivalent to that of <TARGET_CIT> .

o	Studies of vortex behavior in a Ward chamber ( <TARGET_CIT> ) have shown that when the swirl ratio is in a certain range , the flow configuration takes on a structure that resembles a champagne glass .
o	Also , recent work of <TARGET_CIT> suggests that a significant amount of the perturbation energy in tornadoes is due to stretching of asymmetries by the updraft near the surface , " bringing the flow closer to solid body rotation , " further supporting the idea of an inverse energy cascade .
o	Particularly relevant to us is the theory of Banach representations of dynamical systems as developed by Glasner and Megrelishvili in a series of papers ( see <TARGET_CIT> and the references therein )
o	Shortly after , Bah and Tanner improved these bounds in <TARGET_CIT> by preventing the use of union bound over all sub - matrices built from <MATH> columns of <MATH> by grouping those which share a substantial number of columns .
o	Additionally , in thm : thm3 we compute the Hausdorff dimension of the set <MATH> of <MATH> 's which are well - approximable of <MATH> -type , by relating <MATH> to Jarnik and exact Jarnik sets and by using the results of <TARGET_CIT> .
o	In <TARGET_CIT> it was numerically checked that Theorem thm_ahlswede_aydinian does not give strictly tighter bounds than Theorem thm_johnson_cdc for all <MATH> , <MATH> , and <MATH> .
o	A Hodge map for the Podles sphere was defined by Majid in <TARGET_CIT> , and the induced Laplace and Dirac operators studied .

o	Consider the <MATH> -category <MATH> of Soergel bimodules for the symmetric group <MATH> , see <TARGET_CIT> and Subsection s6.2 .
o	Introduction In this paper , we are interested in the following 1D transport equation with nonlocal velocity which was introduced by Cordoba , Cordoba and Fontelos in <TARGET_CIT> : <MATH> where , <MATH> denotes the Hilbert transform defined by <MATH> H 1 PV ( y)y - x dy <MATH> and <MATH> where <MATH> is a positive constant and <MATH> .
p	<MATH> As pointed out in <TARGET_CIT> , this family of kernels is particularly useful on histograms .
o	We also recall the definition of whole - plane SLE <MATH> for <MATH> <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Let us denote by <MATH> , <MATH> , the generators of <MATH> introduced by A.Vishik in <TARGET_CIT> , quadratic analogues of the elements <MATH> ( recall that <MATH> is split )
o	Until now , fully non - equilibrium calculations have been restricted to the weakly coupled electron gas <TARGET_CIT> or to classical <TARGET_CIT> .
o	This is the expected property <TARGET_CIT> .
o	However , probabilities of evolutionary histories over rooted haplotype trees are not readily available ; models such as the coalescent with mutations are , instead , available <TARGET_CIT> .
o	<TARGET_CIT> and <MATH> yield that <MATH> is Seifert - fibered ( resp . toroidal , hyperbolic ) if and only if <MATH> is periodic ( resp . reducible , pseudo - Anosov )
p	Despite the relatively low - memory requirements , it is often desirable to employ scalable parallel versions the ALS algorithm <TARGET_CIT> to compute the canonical tensor expansion functional - SSE .
o	The smallest order for a non - Hamiltonian <MATH> graph from Haythorpe <MATH> <TARGET_CIT> is found to be 30 , and the <MATH> cage has order 14 .
o	By the construction of space - filling SLE <TARGET_CIT> the law of each curve <MATH> stopped at the first time it exits a bounded set at positive distance from <MATH> is absolutely continuous with respect to that of a whole - plane SLE <MATH> stopped at the same time .
o	Minimal models for genus 2 curves over <MATH> can be computed in Magma <TARGET_CIT> via the function MinimalWeierstrassModel , implemented by Michael Stoll .
o	For example , in <TARGET_CIT> it was possible to generalize the result of C. Lomp <TARGET_CIT> using globalization , proving an analogue of the Blattner - Montgomery duality theorem <TARGET_CIT>
o	Theorem T : hausDim extends a result of Garber garber : <TARGET_CIT> , on the Julia set of a single rational map of degree <MATH> , to finitely generated semigroups .
o	In this paper , we use the <MATH> -cocyles constructed in Banks - Levy - Sepanski <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Recently , this model received lots of attention in view of the hints of large hadron collider ( LHC ) about the existence of new physics around the TeV corner : CMS <MATH> excess CMSeejj , ATLAS diboson excess <TARGET_CIT> and very recently , the 750 GeV diphoton excess <TARGET_CIT> . Although the subsequent updates from the LHC experiments LHC16update did not confirm their preliminary results hinting the existence of this 750 GeV resonance , the usual motivations to study LRSM have remained the same .
o	These spaces are known to be complete ( see <TARGET_CIT> and the appendix in Kitch - Wil - <TARGET_CIT> )
o	By the discussion just after ig4 , this counterflow line is a whole - plane SLE <MATH> process from <MATH> to 0 so by reversibility <TARGET_CIT> , <MATH> has the law of a whole - plane SLE <MATH> from 0 to <MATH> .
o	By Assumptions as : momP_AS ( iv ) and as : bcs1 , Assumptions A.1-A.4 in <TARGET_CIT> hold , which in turn implies that , by their Lemma D.1.2 , <MATH> is Donsker and pre - Gaussian uniformly in <MATH> .
o	Recall from <TARGET_CIT> the existence of an isomorphism of algebras , <MATH> which , together with the isomorphism <MATH> , reduces the pairing ( equa : pairingS2 ) to the determination of <MATH> .
o	The six - vertex model with field - free boundary conditions was solved by Lieb <TARGET_CIT> , Sutherland <TARGET_CIT> and Baxter <TARGET_CIT> and were motivating examples that led to the discovery of quantum groups .
o	Before we start the details of the proof , we present Stein 's lemma <TARGET_CIT> that will be used several times in this paper .
o	It uses the Yang - Baxter equations from this paper , and supplementary ones from Gray <TARGET_CIT> , to reprove the main result of <TARGET_CIT> , which may be expressed as the equality of the partition functions of two different ice models .
o	In the particular case of Gaussian bandit models , the work of Chang and Lai <TARGET_CIT> on the approximation of discounted Gittins indices can also be adapted to obtain approximations of the Finite - Horizon Gittins indices , showing the same tendency as in index : Katehakis : compared to the corresponding kl - UCB index , here the <MATH> is replaced by <MATH> .
o	This is an iidversion of the so - called Helffer - Sjostrand representation formula HS-94 ( see also <TARGET_CIT> ) , which holds for any product measure <MATH> on <MATH> .
o	Similarly to the PatchMatch algorithm <TARGET_CIT> , this iterative algorithm has propagation ( lines 1 - 4 ) and refinement ( lines 9 - 14 ) steps .
o	<TARGET_CIT> further use frequency domain to study long - run risks .
o	Hence , we propose a variant of HyperFace that is built using the ResNet-101 <TARGET_CIT> model instead of AlexNet <TARGET_CIT> . The proposed network called HyperFace - ResNet ( HF - ResNet ) significantly improves upon its AlexNet baseline for all the tasks of face detection , landmarks localization , pose estimation and gender recognition .
p	It is built on duality - theoretic insights <TARGET_CIT> and uniformly exports the state - of - the - art in Sahlqvist theory from normal modal logic to a wide range of logics which include , among others , intuitionistic and distributive and general ( non - distributive ) lattice - based ( modal ) logics <TARGET_CIT> , non - normal ( regular ) modal logics based on distributive lattices of arbitrary modal signature <TARGET_CIT> , hybrid logics <TARGET_CIT> , many valued logics , <TARGET_CIT> and bi - intuitionistic and lattice - based modal mu - calculus <TARGET_CIT> .
o	We then use the concentration inequality of Hoeffding <TARGET_CIT> , following from the classical Chernoff bound , to show genericity .
p	A novelty in <TARGET_CIT> is the introduction of more complex problem dependent sampling that can reduce the number of random features .
n	In principle , stereo methods using PatchMatch inference <TARGET_CIT> can not take advantage of the cost filtering acceleration , since in those methods the candidate disparity labels are given dynamically to each pixel and we can not make a consistent - label cost - volume slice <MATH> .
o	The impact of the resolution on the solutions can also be examined by computing the variance of each variable of the barotropic and baroclinic streamfunctions , since these are associated with the kinetic and potential energy of the system <TARGET_CIT> .
o	YTD ( Yau - Tian - Donaldson conjecture ) Combining Theorem A ( ii ) with <TARGET_CIT> and a very recent result by R. Berman , T. Darvas and C. Lu <TARGET_CIT> we in fact further see that <MATH> is uniformly K - stable if <MATH> admits a constant scalar curvature representative and <MATH> .
o	However , interaction is known to be beneficial in one - sided data transfer ( <MATH> <TARGET_CIT> )
n	<TARGET_CIT> studied contention attacks on the schedulers of memory controllers . However , due to advances in computer hardware design , caches and DRAMs are larger and their management policies more sophisticated , so these prior attacks may not work in modern cloud settings .
o	Decomposition of LMO Density For an arbitrary labeled RFS , its multi - object density can be decomposed as the product of the joint existence probability of the label set and the joint probability density of states conditional on their corresponding labels refr : <TARGET_CIT> .
o	We also evaluate a simple ( approximate ) no - swap - regret algorithm by <TARGET_CIT> , which we denote as " nr " from now on .
o	The <MATH> -machine model is closely related to the BSP model <TARGET_CIT> ; it can be considered to be a simplified version of BSP , where local computation is ignored and synchronization happens at the end of every round ( the synchronization cost is ignored ) . Unlike BSP which has a lot of different parameters ( which typically makes it harder to prove rigorous theoretical bounds grigory - blog ) , the <MATH> -machine model is characterized by one parameter ( the number of machines ) which allows one to develop and prove clean bounds and serves as a basis for comparing various distributed algorithms .
o	Note that there are mainly two differences between this algorithm and our previous version <TARGET_CIT> .
p	This approach thus alleviates the constraints of Chorin 's lattice model and incorporates Chorin 's argument for fractal cross section ( <TARGET_CIT> ) . The authors show that vortices with cross sections of fractal dimension greater than <MATH> can exist with finite energy and finite partition functions over all positive temperatures and a limited range of negative temperatures .
o	The foliation <MATH> has been considered by Drach in another context ( see <TARGET_CIT> )
o	See <TARGET_CIT> and <TARGET_CIT> )
o	If <MATH> contains a function whose image is an independent set , then <MATH> equals the CSP for a reduct of <MATH> by Lemma lem : emptyendo , and such CSPs are either in P or NP - complete <TARGET_CIT> .
o	For example , for <MATH> graphs , the lower bound is 258 and upper bound is 384 , the non - existence of <MATH> HBGs between orders 258 and 384 for symmetry factors 4 , 5 , 6 , and emptiness of many other subclasses as per the non - existence lists , has been shown as discussed in <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Then by the canonicity of <MATH> -inductive <MATH> -inequalities ( see <TARGET_CIT> ) , we get <MATH> .
o	<MATH> From the argument of <MATH> and <MATH> as in the proof of <TARGET_CIT> , the left side is the preimage <MATH> , and the the right side is <MATH> ( _ y(f_)^()-()-1_)(_y(f)_y(f _
o	The Prime Graph Question became even more approachable by a reduction result <TARGET_CIT> .
o	The final lfp coalgebra exists and is the colimit of the inclusion <MATH> , and it is a fixpoint of <MATH> ( see <TARGET_CIT> ) called the rational fixpoint of <MATH> .
p	Furthermore , the theory of Lie groupoids <TARGET_CIT> could provide a useful language to describe partial actions of Lie groups over smooth manifolds .
o	In the context of collective risk theory this hitting time can be interpreted as a ruin time associated to the entrance of <MATH> in the set <MATH> ( see <TARGET_CIT> )
o	Note that is was proved in <TARGET_CIT> that the reduction has one of the listed forms , so it remains only to understand the locus where each reduction occurs .
o	Proof of Claim 1 , see also <TARGET_CIT> .
o	A more suitable estimate for the susceptibility for finite systems is given by <TARGET_CIT> <MATH> .
o	Then the line bundle <MATH> is relatively ample when <MATH> <TARGET_CIT> , and it inherits a <MATH> -linearization from <MATH> ( cf . e.g. the discussion in HL-2010 )
o	Finding the maximum of lebesgue function involves computing the solution to an optimization problem in infinite dimensions <TARGET_CIT> .
o	They are used in Wei - <TARGET_CIT> in proving a Neumann type maximal principle without volume lower bound .
o	<MATH> This limit exists and is independent of choice of ample divisor ( <TARGET_CIT> )
n	This is indeed possible ; the resulting category is the cyclotomic category that appeared e.g. in <TARGET_CIT> , and when the theory is fully developed , it provides a notion of a " cyclotomic Mackey functor " . However , doing all this properly requires a lot of work and a lot of space , and we will return to it elsewhere .
p	What is different here from similar results in the repeated games literature is that this is true even when Player 2s strategies are non - Bayesian.(A relevant result appears in <TARGET_CIT> , which shows that sequential equilibrium payoffs and perfect public equilibrium payoffs coincide ( See the Appendix B of <TARGET_CIT> ) in a similar infinitely repeated game setup .
o	For this purpose , we mostly mimic the argument required to show the stochastic equicontinuity of empirical processes <TARGET_CIT> .
o	For a detailed list of these results , see Section 3.1 of <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Then <MATH> is an infinite dimensional example of Springer theory formulated in <TARGET_CIT> , as a uniform way to look at various examples of geometric constructions of noncommutative algebras via convolution .
o	In fact , the Gupta - Kumar conjecture Gupta99 on the connectivity of <MATH> where <MATH> represents an Erdos - Renyi ( ER ) graph , took many years ( and several attempts ) to be resolved eventually by Penrose <TARGET_CIT> ; see Yagan / <TARGET_CIT> for a detailed discussion on the difficulties involved in analyzing intersection of different types of graphs .
o	We now take a moment to situate the current paper in the context of our own previous work <TARGET_CIT> . The earlier paper presents results on stochastic optimization , and to provide guarantees it assumes a particular noise model for preventing disclosure that restricts its applicability specifically to such optimization problems . In contrast , here we provide a suite of new results via new techniques ; as noted in the preceding paragraphs , we give private versions of three classical minimax techniques - those due to Le Cam , Fano and Assouad - and show how to apply them to several estimation problems .
o	<TARGET_CIT> A standard ntytt rule <MATH> is rooted branching bisimulation safe w.r.t . <MATH> and <MATH> if it satisfies the following conditions .
o	The notions of differential map , and left - covariance when the calculus is defined over a <MATH> , have obvious first - order analogues , for details see <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Further , we set <MATH> and , according to Mahler <TARGET_CIT> , we say that <MATH> is an <MATH> <MATH> -number , if <MATH> ; <MATH> -number , if <MATH> ; <MATH> -number , if <MATH> and <MATH> for any integer <MATH> ; <MATH> -number , if <MATH> and <MATH> for some integer <MATH> .
o	From <TARGET_CIT> , we deduce the existence of a homeomorphism of filtered spaces , <MATH> where <MATH> is a ( possibly empty ) compact filtered space and <MATH> .
p	Recently , progress has been made in producing active particles 2013RMP_Marchetti , anisotropic particles 2013JPCM_Sacanna and particles with tunable interactions <TARGET_CIT> .
o	We may assume that the readers are familiar with basic definitions and properties of open book foliations that can be found in ik1 - <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Here , we consider the coordinates of <TARGET_CIT> referring to the quadratic ensemble ( see section 4 and 5.3 of <TARGET_CIT> ) where the warped Cardy formula takes the form of a Cardy formula .

p	In this section we will specialise to the family of circuits proposed by Bremner , Montanaro , and Shepherd <TARGET_CIT> , for which there is strong complexity - theoretic evidence ( in contrast to Shor 's algorithm ) that their output probability distribution is hard to simulate on any classical computer within an error of <MATH> in total variation distance . While this result on its own is remarkable , one might question whether the " theoretically hard " quantum state has actually been prepared in an experiment . However , using our certification result , one can indeed certify the sufficiently precise preparation of a quantum state , such that measurements in the <MATH> -basis are intractable for classical computers under a plausible complexity - theoretic
p	A first , though incomplete , application in the field of statistical physics , in particular for the Potts model , has been presented by Murray <TARGET_CIT> . The Potts model provides , despite of its simple structure , a wide variety of interesting physical properties and the availability of exact results for certain quantities of the two dimensional model makes it an optimal playground for testing new approaches in simulation techniques .
n	Because the <TARGET_CIT> 's estimator has a rather slow rate of convergence of <MATH> and because the wavelet ( variance ) covariance estimator converges at rate <MATH> <TARGET_CIT> , our estimator converges at a rate of <MATH> , and the asymptotic variance is not increased by wavelet decomposition as a result of the variance - preserving property of the wavelets : <MATH> .
o	Theorem This lower bound is implemented as partialspread3 and equals the size of the construction of Beutelspacher , see <TARGET_CIT> .
o	The <MATH> choice for the universal case of <TARGET_CIT> follows as a special case since for the universal setup with IID source <MATH> can vary over an interval of length <MATH> .

o	In this case , <MATH> is a module over the ring <MATH> , which is a Dedekind domain ( see for example theorem 2.6 in <TARGET_CIT> )
o	Such idea is achieved by some proper scalings of the latitude coordinate <MATH> , and is closely related to the second microlocalization along the equator , as illustrated by B - G - Stabilization - Wave - <TARGET_CIT> .
o	<MATH> From these isomorphisms , we obtain a spectral sequence <TARGET_CIT> <MATH> .

p	<TARGET_CIT> , motivated by the work of Chorin and some numerical experiments , consider single three - dimensional vortices with Brownian or smooth cores , possibly fractal cross sections , and positive and negative temperatures . This approach thus alleviates the constraints of Chorin 's lattice model and incorporates Chorin 's argument for fractal cross section ( chorin ) . The authors show that vortices with cross sections of fractal dimension greater than <MATH> can exist with finite energy and finite partition functions over all positive temperatures and a limited range of negative temperatures .

o	In <TARGET_CIT> we asked whether <MATH> has a limit as <MATH> tends to infinity .

p	Mathematically , a multiplicative cascade , is a measure - valued stochastic process and was first rigorously described by Kahane and Peyriere kahane : <TARGET_CIT> . They presented a complete proof of results announced by Mandelbrot , answering e.g. the questions of non - degeneracy , existence of moments and local properties . Since then multiplicative cascades become a subject of study for numerous mathematicians , see e.g.

o	Ruloids To decompose modal formulas , we use a result from <TARGET_CIT> , where for any standard TSS <MATH> in ready simulation format a collection of decent nxytt rules , called <MATH> -ruloids , is constructed .
o	However this requires that <MATH> a.e . , but we can not make such conclusion directly , as the convergence for the composition <MATH> generally requires the continuity of <MATH> <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Moreover , the potential <MATH> can be obtained from the toric potential <MATH> ^toric = u_1 + u_2 + Tu_1 + Tu_2 + T^1 - u_1u_2 + T^1 - u_2u_1 , <MATH> via wall - crossing transformation <MATH> , <MATH> , giving another example where actual computations meet wall - crossing predictions <TARGET_CIT> .

p	<TARGET_CIT> have proposed a large N <MATH>  method to evaluate hadronic weak matrix elements to attack for instance the determination of the  <MATH> -rule and  <MATH> . Here we test this method to the determination of the form factor parameters  <MATH>  and  <MATH>  in the decays  <MATH>  and  <MATH> . The results are encouraging : in particular after a complete treatment of Vector Meson Dominance ( VMD ) . Rare kaon decays play a crucial role in particle physics <TARGET_CIT> particularly now with the beautiful physics program of NA62 <TARGET_CIT> , where 100 events of  <MATH>  are expected and the J - PARC KOTO experiment with the goal of a few  <MATH>  SM events in 3 - 4 years run with Signal / Noise ratio  <MATH> <TARGET_CIT> <TARGET_CIT> .
o	The measurement of this decay may also lead to New Physics test <TARGET_CIT> .
o	There is also an indirect CP - Violating contribution from  <MATH> , the magnitude of which can be obtained from the measured BR for the corresponding  <MATH>  decay <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Also a theoretical determination is needed and the recent lattice RBC and UKQCD Collaborations <TARGET_CIT> address this issue .
p	the experimental form factor here has been measured well by NA48/2 <TARGET_CIT> .
o	The appearance of chiral unknown constants <TARGET_CIT> brings up the crucial question to determine them either by lattice <TARGET_CIT> or in a model dependent manner <TARGET_CIT> as we will do in this paper .
o	Since one can measure  <MATH>  and  <MATH>  separately , the question of Lepton Flavor Universality Violation is also interesting <TARGET_CIT> .
p	In this paper we will evaluate the  <MATH>  form factor in the theoretical framework suggested by Bardeen - Buras - Gerard ( BBG ) <TARGET_CIT> ; the authors of this approach have successfully applied the method to the explanation of the  <MATH> rule and  <MATH> -mass difference : we think it is interesting to apply it here .
o	The recent lattice result from RBC and UKQCD Collaborations <TARGET_CIT> reporting on the  <MATH>  matrix element  <MATH>  and  <MATH>  leading to  <MATH> - <MATH>  below the experimental world average of  <MATH>  has led the authors of Refs . <TARGET_CIT> to evaluate the same weak matrix elements  <MATH>  and  <MATH>  in their approach , finding consistency with lattice results and they conclude <TARGET_CIT> that New Physics seems required to accommodate the present experimental value of  <MATH> .
o	Using Large N <MATH>  and Minimal Hadronic Ansatz , Hambye et al . in Ref . <TARGET_CIT> still find agreement with experimental values .
o	Final state interaction is not accurately described by lattice ( the lattice result <TARGET_CIT> for the  <MATH>  phase - shift  <MATH>  is about  <MATH>  smaller than the value obtained in dispersive treatments of Ref . <TARGET_CIT> ) and a good theoretical description could lead to agreement with experiments as the approach of Refs . <TARGET_CIT> ;
o	for an alternative solution see Ref . <TARGET_CIT> .
o	The decay  <MATH>  is dominated by a virtual photon exchange <TARGET_CIT> ,  <MATH> .
o	In this way ,  <MATH>  can be written as <TARGET_CIT> ,  <MATH> .
o	with a priori unknown low - energy constants contributing to  <MATH>  and  <MATH>  which have to be experimentally determined <TARGET_CIT> .
o	<MATH>  is obtained from the analytic structure of the diagram in Fig . <TARGET_CIT> .
o	In Ref . <TARGET_CIT> , the behaviour of  <MATH>  at  <MATH>  is entirely fixed up to  <MATH> ,  <MATH> . where  <MATH>  and  <MATH>  are the  <MATH>  parameters from Ref . <TARGET_CIT> .
o	The local counter - term structures at  <MATH>  are  <MATH> . where  <MATH>  is given <TARGET_CIT> in terms of  <MATH> 's <TARGET_CIT> and  <MATH> <TARGET_CIT> by  <MATH> .
o	Experimentally <TARGET_CIT> , we have  <MATH> .
o	Indeed ,  <MATH> ,  <MATH>  and the  <MATH> 's have large contributions from the VMD <TARGET_CIT> , since  <MATH>  is mostly a  <MATH>  observable , it should have an important enhancement .
o	the long - distance ( LD ) one described by chiral perturbation theory ( <MATH> PT ) <TARGET_CIT> ,
o	and ( ii ) the short - distance ( SD ) one described by an effective four - quark Hamiltonian <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Some of the consequences of this SD property will be considered in a model independent form in Ref . <TARGET_CIT> .
o	The Bardeen - Buras - Gerard framework In Ref . <TARGET_CIT> , the authors use an order  <MATH>  chiral Lagrangian and a physical cut - off  <MATH>  to regularize the contributions beyond tree level instead of the usual local counter - terms ( e.g. the  <MATH>  and  <MATH>  constants )
o	But this evolution implies a mixing between the operators  <MATH>  and  <MATH>  according to RGE <TARGET_CIT> .
o	In the BBG framework , this mixing is captured by the quadratic divergences <TARGET_CIT> which in our case can come only from the  <MATH>  vertex ( chiraly related to  <MATH>  studied by BBG see below )
o	In other words , the authors of Ref . <TARGET_CIT> have extended the usual renormalization flow of the SD sector ( from  <MATH>  to  <MATH> ) to a flow in the LD sector from  <MATH>  to  <MATH>  ( as depicted in Fig . ) through the relation ,  <MATH> . where  <MATH>  is the evolution operator given by <TARGET_CIT> ,  <MATH> . with  <MATH>  GeV.
o	<MATH>  comes from the  <MATH>  analysis in Ref . <TARGET_CIT> , and soft - pion theorem tells us that it can be applied to  <MATH>  vertex <TARGET_CIT> .
o	The authors of Ref . <TARGET_CIT> find that the range of numerical values for  <MATH>  that leaves the amplitude invariant is ,  <MATH> .
o	Following Buchalla et al . in Ref . <TARGET_CIT> , we investigate our predictions of what the authors call  <MATH>  and  <MATH> .
o	Indeed , we find ,  <MATH> . which is in good agreement with  <MATH> <TARGET_CIT> .
o	And , in this case , the local counter - term structures at  <MATH>  are <TARGET_CIT>  <MATH> . where  <MATH>  is <TARGET_CIT>  <MATH> .
o	Using the same identification as in eq . eq : Wexpansion and following the same procedure as in the case of the decay  <MATH> , we find that  <MATH>  <MATH> <TARGET_CIT> ) for the same scale  <MATH>  GeV established from eq .
o	And , in this case , the local counter - term structures at  <MATH>  are <TARGET_CIT>  <MATH> . where  <MATH>  is <TARGET_CIT>  <MATH> .
o	This value is in agreement with the fitted  <MATH>  value obtained in Ref . <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Consistency with the full chiral structure of the weak counter - terms has required a more general discussion on vector contributions ( see section VI and Fig.4 ) that leads to an extension of the  <MATH>  evolution studied by the authors of Ref . <TARGET_CIT> in the context of  <MATH> .
o	This extension met nicely with the experimental values <TARGET_CIT> .
o	The  <MATH>  function is the one defined in Ref . <TARGET_CIT> and it is related to the  <MATH>  in Ref . <TARGET_CIT> as  <MATH> .
o	For instance , a typical search engine needs to crawl and index billions of web pages which accumulate to a multi - terabyte database <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Content - based image retrieval systems now have to answer similarity queries over billion - size image databases <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Large - scale collaborative filtering engines have to deal with tens of millions users ' data <TARGET_CIT> .
o	For instance , a near - duplicate detection system uses hashing techniques <TARGET_CIT> <TARGET_CIT> to represent documents as binary vectors , and identifies them as near - duplicates if their Hamming distances are smaller than a threshold radius .
o	In content - based image retrieval systems , a standard approach is to learn short binary codes to represent image objects such that the Hamming distance between codes reflects their neighborhood or semantic similarity in the original space <TARGET_CIT> , see e.g. <TARGET_CIT> and its references .
o	Similarity search in Hamming space dates back to Minsky and Papert <TARGET_CIT> , who referred to it as the approximate dictionary problem .
o	Due to the " curse of dimensionality " , the performance of indexing techniques based on data or space partitioning generally degrades as dimensionality increases , and is eventually no better than a simple linear search <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Since 1998 locality - sensitive hashing ( LSH ) <TARGET_CIT> has emerged as a basic primitive for near neighbor search in high - dimensional space .
p	Since its first introduction , several LSH schemes <TARGET_CIT> and efficient LSH - based methods for near neighbor search <TARGET_CIT> have been proposed for a wide range of distance functions in high - dimensional space .
o	We refer to <TARGET_CIT> for an up - to - date overview of developments .
p	For the problem of large - scale image search and recognition , learning binary codes for images to preserve their neighborhood or semantic similarity <TARGET_CIT> ( see <TARGET_CIT> and its references ) is widely used due to the simplicity of the representation and fast query processing . False negative findings in querying a binary code can degrade the performance of classification and retrieval tasks . In fact , such methods often perform brute - force search for answering near neighbor queries .
o	Recently researchers have found that the binary codes must be long enough ( hundreds of bits ) to preserve discrimination power and to achieve good performance <TARGET_CIT> , see <TARGET_CIT> and its references .
o	In a recent theoretical study , CoveringLSH <TARGET_CIT> was proposed to address the issue of false negatives in LSH for Hamming space .
p	Instead of independently selecting bit positions from high - dimensional binary vectors as the classic LSH method <TARGET_CIT> , CoveringLSH carefully chooses correlated bit positions that " cover " all possible positions of  <MATH>  differences , and thus eliminate false negatives .
o	We found that although the method can avoid false negatives and match the asymptotic complexity bound of classical LSH <TARGET_CIT> , substantial practical improvements are possible . Observe that for  <MATH>  we can decrease the size of the hash values from  <MATH>  to  <MATH>  bits each , while not significantly changing collision probabilities , by applying universal hashing <TARGET_CIT> .
o	By setting  <MATH> , the second approximate version , called  <MATH> -near neighbor reporting , has more practical applications <TARGET_CIT> <TARGET_CIT> since it reports all points within distance  <MATH>  to the query .
o	It is worth noting that solving the exact  <MATH> -NN problem implies an exact solution to the nearest neighbor problem with comparable performance by building several solutions for different radii <TARGET_CIT> .
o	The classic LSH family for Hamming distance uses a bit sampling approach <TARGET_CIT> . It is simply the family of all the projections of points to one dimension , i.e. , a hash function value is just a random bit sample .
o	For the bit sampling family  <MATH> ,  <MATH>  which is optimal for data - independent LSH in Hamming space <TARGET_CIT> .
o	There are different filtering strategies corresponding to  <MATH> -NN and  <MATH> -NN problems <TARGET_CIT> .
n	Strategy 1 that interrupts the search after retrieving  <MATH>  points ( including duplicates ) is of significant importance in theory because it introduces a sub - linear time algorithm with suitable choices of  <MATH>  and  <MATH>  for the  <MATH> -NN problem <TARGET_CIT> . In particular , it runs in  <MATH>  time where  <MATH>  if we suitably choose  <MATH> ,  <MATH> , and interrupt the searching process after retrieving the first  <MATH>  points . Using the bit sampling family  <MATH> , it solves the  <MATH> -NN problem in sub - linear time  <MATH>  using  <MATH>  space . Despite of the attractive asymptotic space and query performance , Strategy 1 may give undesirable quality of results compared to Strategy 2 .
p	Strategy 2 enables us to solve the  <MATH> -NN problem , which has more practical applications <TARGET_CIT> . It provides better result quality since all reported points are within distance  <MATH>  to the query point . It might run in  <MATH>  time in the worst case , but for many natural data sets , proper settings of  <MATH>  and  <MATH>  still result in a sub - linear query time <TARGET_CIT> . However , Strategy 2 can introduce false negatives if some near points do not collide with the query under any hash function .
o	It might run in  <MATH>  time in the worst case , but for many natural data sets , proper settings of  <MATH>  and  <MATH>  still result in a sub - linear query time <TARGET_CIT> .
o	According to <TARGET_CIT> , this family is universal which means that the probability of collision is small if  <MATH>  is sufficiently large ( say ,  <MATH>  when hashing a set of  <MATH>  vectors )
p	In very recent work <TARGET_CIT> , a novel LSH scheme was proposed to solve the exact  <MATH> -NN problem .
o	According to <TARGET_CIT> , this family is universal which means that the probability of collision is small if  <MATH>  is sufficiently large ( say ,  <MATH>  when hashing a set of  <MATH>  vectors )
p	In very recent work <TARGET_CIT> , a novel LSH scheme was proposed to solve the exact  <MATH> -NN problem . This method always introduces a collision for every pair of binary vectors within a given radius  <MATH> . Instead of independently selecting bit positions as in the bit sampling approach , CoveringLSH carefully chooses correlated bit positions so that it can " cover " all possible positions of  <MATH>  differences , which implies an exact guarantee for the  <MATH> -NN problem when used with Strategy 2 . The underlying LSH definition is as follows . The new  <MATH> -covering LSH scheme can not only eliminate the problem of false negatives but also essentially match the complexity bound of the seminal LSH construction of Indyk and Motwani <TARGET_CIT> if  <MATH> .
n	Also , an embedding process to Hamming space can require high dimensionality , e.g. , embedding  <MATH> -norm into Hamming space by a unary representation <TARGET_CIT> , semantic hashing to embed images into Hamming space <TARGET_CIT> . This issue demands significant computational resources for computing  <MATH> -covering hash codes .
o	It is observed in <TARGET_CIT> that  <MATH>  can be seen as sampling a subset of  <MATH>  since the random mapping  <MATH>  is a subset of  <MATH> .
o	We use a method from <TARGET_CIT> to handle the constraint  <MATH> .
o	We now present two variants of the fcLSH scheme : a general construction using a random mapping  <MATH>  for  <MATH>  as introduced in <TARGET_CIT> and a specific construction using a random permutation  <MATH>  for  <MATH> .
o	The total running time is  <MATH> , which can be compared to  <MATH>  of the basic  <MATH> -covering LSH scheme <TARGET_CIT> .
o	The second property says that fcLSH has the same pruning power as the classic LSH scheme <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Following up to the proof of <TARGET_CIT> , , we have :
o	This follows from the proof of <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Using the proofs of <TARGET_CIT> and <TARGET_CIT> , we can verify the claim .
o	Given a prime  <MATH>  and any random seed vector  <MATH> , Algorithm alg : FHT computes the same hash values as using  <MATH>  in Equation ( eq : universal ) on the  <MATH> -covering LSH scheme introduced in <TARGET_CIT> .
o	However , according to <TARGET_CIT> , we derive the following extension of Theorem thm : collision for fcLSH .
o	This observation matches the theoretical analysis in <TARGET_CIT> , which states that the  <MATH> -covering scheme differs from the classic LSH scheme by at most a factor  <MATH>  in the exponent for the general values of  <MATH> .
o	We compared the performance of hashing - based algorithms for reporting all near neighbors , including our fcLSH scheme , the basic  <MATH> -covering LSH <TARGET_CIT> , the classic LSH scheme <TARGET_CIT> , and the multi - index hashing approach <TARGET_CIT> on synthetic and real - world data sets .
o	bcLSH : The basic covering construction <TARGET_CIT> based on random samples from Hadamard codes .
p	LSH : The classic LSH <TARGET_CIT> using bit sampling approach .
o	However , the sub - linear guarantees of MIH is based on the strong assumption of uniform distribution of data points which is not true in many natural data sets <TARGET_CIT> <TARGET_CIT> .
o	For the general  <MATH> -covering LSH schemes , including fcLSH and bcLSH <TARGET_CIT> , we only need the partition trick when  <MATH>  is large ( say ,  <MATH> ) since in that case we might not have enough space for  <MATH>  hash tables .

o	Typically , we use a bitmap string of  <MATH>  bits to remove such duplicates <TARGET_CIT> .
o	ANNSIFT1 M <TARGET_CIT> contains 1 million 128-dimensional SIFT feature vectors of images .
o	This difference is at most  <MATH>  in the worst - case data sets as analyzed in <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Due to the " curse of dimensionality " , one typically uses linear search for ( exact ) near neighbor search in high - dimensional Hamming space <TARGET_CIT> .
p	To trade precision for speed , approximate retrieval is widely investigated in the research literature , and LSH <TARGET_CIT> is a widely used technique due to its attractive " tradeoff " between time and space . . However , false negatives findings limit the applicability of LSH in settings requiring precise performance guarantees .
n	Recently , Norouzi et . al . <TARGET_CIT> proposed the MIH approach which partitions each data vector to reduce the search radius , and then applies exhaustive search . Although the MIH approach has sub - linear running time behaviour for uniformly distributed data sets , it does not work well in general .
n	An approach similar to MIH was taken in <TARGET_CIT> , with the same vulnerability .
n	Arasu et al . <TARGET_CIT> proposed the idea that randomly permuting the dimensions of data vectors increases the robustness of partitioning , and make performance guarantees possible for data sets that are not uniformly distributed . They combined this idea with another level of partitioning within which a " brute force "  <MATH> -cover is found . For  <MATH>  the scheme is never better than CoveringLSH .
p	For  <MATH>  the scheme is never better than CoveringLSH <TARGET_CIT> . In the case of a single partition the number of hash values needed by <TARGET_CIT> is  <MATH> , which is much larger than  <MATH>  required by our Hadamard code - based method for the same filtering efficiency .

o	Second , the use of unlabeled data does not help general transduction , since supervised learning algorithms such as ERM and <TARGET_CIT> match our transductive lower bounds while ignoring the unlabeled test set . < END >
o	Transductive learning <TARGET_CIT> considers two sets of data : a training set containing  <MATH>  labeled samples , and an unlabeled set containing  <MATH>  unlabeled samples .
p	More generally , transductive learning has found a wide and diverse range of successful applications , including text categorization , image colorization , image compression , image segmentation , reconstruction of protein interaction networks , speech tagging , and statistical machine translation ; all of these discussed and referenced in <TARGET_CIT>
o	For further discussions on transductive learning , see <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Our proofs are inspired by their counterparts in inductive learning <TARGET_CIT> , which rely on the worst case analysis of binary classification and the probabilistic method .
o	Second , we realize that the use of unlabeled data does not help general transductive learning , since supervised learning algorithms such as empirical risk minimization and the algorithm of <TARGET_CIT> match our transductive lower bounds while ignoring the unlabeled test set . < END >
o	Third , we use our transductive lower bounds to derive lower bounds for semi - supervised learning , and relate them to the impossibility results of <TARGET_CIT> and <TARGET_CIT>
o	In this paper , we analyze the two settings of transductive learning proposed by <TARGET_CIT>
o	Table table : settings summarizes the differences between TLSI and TLSII , when compared together with inductive supervised learning <TARGET_CIT> denoted by SL , and inductive semi - supervised learning <TARGET_CIT> denoted by SSL .
o	The first two assumptions are commonly used throughout the literature in learning theory <TARGET_CIT>
n	<TARGET_CIT> provides sharp upper bounds for Empirical Risk Minimization ( ERM ) in TLSI . However , these ERM upper bounds are only explicit for the  <MATH>  case .
o	Vap82 provides sharp upper bounds for Empirical Risk Minimization ( ERM ) in TLSI . However , these ERM upper bounds are only explicit for the  <MATH>  case . To amend this issue , <TARGET_CIT> extend these bounds to the  <MATH>  case . In particular , this results in an upper bound for ERM in TLSI of the order  <MATH> , where  <MATH>  is the VC - dimension of the learning hypothesis class  <MATH> .
p	Following a different approach , <TARGET_CIT> provide upper bounds depending on the hypothesis class prior distribution . Under realizability assumptions and good choices of hypothesis class prior distributions , these bounds lead to fast  <MATH>  learning rates .
p	Most recently , <TARGET_CIT> provide general bounds which achieve fast rates  <MATH>  under Tsybakov low noise assumptions , recovering the  <MATH>  upper bound of CM06 with looser constants .
n	Regarding TLSII , upper bounds are usually obtained from the corresponding upper bounds in TLSI <TARGET_CIT> . However , this strategy is in many cases suboptimal , as we will later address in Section sec : consequences .
o	Finding a lower bound to these values guarantees , for every possible transductive learning algorithm  <MATH> , the existence of learning problems which can not be solved by  <MATH>  faster than at a certain learning rate . This is the goal of the rest of this section . Our proofs are inspired by their analogous in the classical setting ( inductive and iid ) of statistical learning theory <TARGET_CIT> .
o	In particular , our arguments involve standard constructions based on  <MATH>  points shattered by  <MATH>  and the use of the probabilistic method <TARGET_CIT> .
p	Remarkably , the rates of our lower bounds are almost identical to the ones from the classical setting of statistical learning theory <TARGET_CIT> which shows that general transduction is as hard as general induction .
o	We conclude by lower bounding the tails of Binomial and hypergeometric distributions using the Chebyshev - Cantelli inequality <TARGET_CIT>
o	First , Empirical Risk Minimization or ERM <TARGET_CIT> denoted by  <MATH> .
o	Second , the majority voting ensemble of ERMs trained on subsets of  <MATH>  proposed by <TARGET_CIT> , denoted by  <MATH> .
o	The argument is a slight modification of <TARGET_CIT> , and also follows from TBK14 .
p	<TARGET_CIT> precise this intuition , by showing that the total variation distance between these two distributions ( the one due to sampling without replacement versus the one due to sampling with replacement ) is bounded between  <MATH>  and  <MATH> .
o	In such limit case , the upper bound of ERM falls back to  <MATH> <TARGET_CIT> .
o	The analogous question in the iid setting served over twenty five years of research , where the series of works <TARGET_CIT> proved minimax lower bounds of the order  <MATH> .
o	At the same time , <TARGET_CIT> showed that the upper bound  <MATH>  is not improvable for ERM .
o	Only recently it was finally proved by <TARGET_CIT> that  <MATH>  rate is achieved by a majority voting supervised algorithm .
o	Unfortunately , the counterexample from <TARGET_CIT> does not apply to TLSI .
o	In particular , the following result is a direct consequence of <TARGET_CIT> and <TARGET_CIT> .
o	It is well known that upper bounds for TLSI lead to upper bounds for TLSII <TARGET_CIT> .
o	We bound this average by using Bernstein 's inequality <TARGET_CIT> and accounting for the fact that  <MATH>  and  <MATH>  can be upper bounded with high probability by using <TARGET_CIT> and <TARGET_CIT>
o	Surprisingly , the TLSII lower bound of Theorem thm : lower - exp - setting2 matches the best known lower bound for supervised learning <TARGET_CIT>
o	Worst case lower bounds for agnostic semi - supervised learning firstly appeared in <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Moreover , the algorithm of <TARGET_CIT> denoted by  <MATH> , exhibits upper bounds of the order  <MATH> .
o	Moreover , the algorithm of <TARGET_CIT> , denoted by  <MATH> , exhibits upper bounds of the order  <MATH> .
o	This discussion relates to the conjectures of <TARGET_CIT> and <TARGET_CIT>
o	First , <TARGET_CIT> conjectures that semi - supervised learning is impossible for any marginal distribution  <MATH> , since it is always possible to find a bad labeling mechanism  <MATH>  which renders the unlabeled set useless .
o	Second , unlabeled data does not help general transductive classification , since supervised learning algorithms , such as ERM and the algorithm of <TARGET_CIT> match our transductive lower bounds while ignoring the unlabeled set .
o	Here we discuss the proof of <TARGET_CIT> and provide two slight improvements .
o	First , inspecting the step from Equation ( 46 ) to Equation ( 47 ) of the proof of <TARGET_CIT> reveals the inequality  <MATH> .
o	However , as argued in <TARGET_CIT> , all upper bounds in realizable transductive classification should have the form  <MATH> .
n	The discrepancy may be due to an inaccuracy in the proof of <TARGET_CIT> . Namely , the proof uses the inequality  <MATH>  but claims , in between Equations 37 and 38 , that " the case  <MATH>  can be treated similarly " . We conjecture that this is not the case : we could not find any similar argument that would lead to a result for the  <MATH>  case .
o	To improve the proof of <TARGET_CIT> , assume that the inequality  <MATH> holds for some constant  <MATH> . Then , this is equivalent to <MATH> . which directly leads to the upper bound of Theorem thm : wrong , with a multiplicative factor of  <MATH>  in its denominator . < END >
o	We may now use these expressions , together with  <MATH> , and the Chebyshev - Cantelli inequality <TARGET_CIT> , to obtain  <MATH> . which holds as long as  <MATH> .
o	Using this inequality and <TARGET_CIT> write  <MATH> where the first inequality is due the structure of a Binomial distribution with an even number of trials .
o	It is well known that upper bounds for TLSI lead to upper bounds for TLSII <TARGET_CIT>
o	Using Bernstein 's inequality <TARGET_CIT> together with the previous expectation and variance , we obtain  <MATH> .
o	On the other hand , using an upper bound of <TARGET_CIT> we get  <MATH> .
o	We can repeat the same argument for  <MATH>  and use the upper bound presented in <TARGET_CIT>
o	Next , we apply the Chebyshev - Cantelli inequality <TARGET_CIT> to lower bound the previous expression .
o	Next , we are interested in applying the Chebyshev - Cantelli inequality <TARGET_CIT> to the random variable  <MATH>  in eq : intermediate3 .
o	We are now ready to apply the Chebyshev - Cantelli inequality <TARGET_CIT> using the expectation eq : expectation3 and the variance eq : variance3 .
o	Another method to construct Besse metrics on <MATH> -spheres is due to Guillemin <TARGET_CIT> . He shows that for any odd function <MATH> on the standard round sphere <MATH> there exists a one - parameter family of smooth functions <MATH> on <MATH> such that <MATH> , <MATH> at <MATH> and such that <MATH> is a Besse metric for small <MATH> .
o	We briefly recapitulate the main results from <TARGET_CIT> and <TARGET_CIT> below .
o	Here we recall a construction , due to Li <TARGET_CIT> , which to a simple degeneration <MATH> over a curve ( Definition def : simple ) , together with an orientation of the dual graph <MATH> of the degenerate fibre <MATH> , associates a family of expanded degenerations <MATH> over an <MATH> -dimensional base <MATH> , equipped with an action by an algebraic torus <MATH> .
o	Under measurement constraints , it is well - known that the statistically optimal subset <MATH> for estimating the regression coefficients is given by the A - optimality criterion optimal - design - <TARGET_CIT> : <MATH> .
o	Here <MATH> where <MATH> is a numerical constant , which is determined by an approximate solution of the leading - order problem in the ridge <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Then by the construction in <TARGET_CIT> Section 0.3 , <MATH> is a maximal abelian subgroup of <MATH> .
o	It was shown in <TARGET_CIT> ( Theorem 2 ) that the following error estimate holds <MATH> . where <MATH> .
o	If necessary it is assumed to be cocomplete and have a monoidal product that commutes with colimits as in <TARGET_CIT> .
p	Ultra - cold gases of fermionic atoms <TARGET_CIT> have extended the physics of gaseous superfluids beyond weakly - interacting BECs by realizing the crossover from a BEC of tightly - bound molecules to a fermionic superfluid with long - range pair correlations described by BCS theory <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Our main theorem is modelled on a result of Milicevic <TARGET_CIT> , which , building on <TARGET_CIT> , provides a structural framework for the class of arithmetic hyperbolic <MATH> -manifolds supporting exceptional sequences .
p	A few years after the bilinear results , Bennett , Carbery , and Tao <TARGET_CIT> proved a sharp <MATH> -linear estimate for <MATH> . <THEOREM> . This theorem is important and remarkable in part because it involves the sharp exponent for the restriction problem : <MATH> .
o	This is very much in the spirit of <TARGET_CIT> , where a local symplectic groupoid integrating a Poisson manifold is constructed by using a symplectic realization .
o	GSexactWeak interactions In the case of weak interactions <MATH> , an analytical result is available for the rapidities of the ground state <TARGET_CIT> .
o	The details can be found in <TARGET_CIT> .
o	The lower bound for <MATH> is known to be 258 as per <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Note the following Abelian inequalities ( see , e.g. , Lemma 5.3.1 in Hernandez - Lerma and Lasserre <TARGET_CIT> ) : Let <MATH> be a sequence of non - negative numbers and <MATH> .
p	In Refs . <TARGET_CIT> , they were performed a serious synthetic exploration of the impact of future SL test data on DE constraints . It was shown that the SL test can break the parameter degeneracies in existing DE probes and significantly improve the precision of DE constraints .
p	The formula is based on a free analogue of Boue - Dupuis formula <TARGET_CIT> for free pressure and is based on a recent improvement by Ustunel <TARGET_CIT> of the original formula , better suited for convex analysis , and applied to hermitian brownian motion ( see also <TARGET_CIT> for a nice introduction and other applications of this formula , and <TARGET_CIT> for an extension to diffusions )
o	While it is mostly more convenient to calculate with actual eigenvalues of representations , the more formal formulation of the method given in HeLP - restrictions provides an algorithm directly implementable in a computer program which has been done in the HeLP package <TARGET_CIT> written by the authors .
o	We apply Giroux elimination lemma <TARGET_CIT> to remove all the positive elliptic and positive hyperbolic points of <MATH> ( see Figure fig : transtousual )
p	While it is easy to see that there are no nonrepetitive sequences of length <MATH> over an alphabet of size <MATH> , Thue 's famous theorem <TARGET_CIT> asserts that there exist arbitrarily long nonrepetitive sequnces over an alphabet of size <MATH> .
o	According to <TARGET_CIT> , this map restricts to an isomorphism on each tensor - factor .

o	Then the abelian group <MATH> acts as a character <MATH> ( <TARGET_CIT> Lemma 3.17 )
o	Then , according to Theorem 4.7 in <TARGET_CIT> , there is an equivalence of additive categories <MATH> .
o	The paper <TARGET_CIT> contains a different but closely related argument .

o	In the Hawking regime , the characteristic length of non - locality becomes smaller than the characteristic length of the gradients <TARGET_CIT> , and as a result , the spectrum becomes entirely governed by the surface gravity , i.e. the gradient of the Froude number at the horizon .
o	Our presentation is based on <TARGET_CIT> and <TARGET_CIT> .
o	From then on , there has been many works on the compact symplectic nonkahler manifolds ( e.g. <TARGET_CIT> , <TARGET_CIT> , <TARGET_CIT> , <TARGET_CIT> , <TARGET_CIT> , <TARGET_CIT> , <TARGET_CIT> , and <TARGET_CIT> )
o	As we mentioned in the introduction , we will show in Section connex that Theorem firstbraid is related to the intertwining integrals for principal series representations of the metaplectic group , which were calculated in Kazhdan and Patterson <TARGET_CIT> .
o	This field was first introduced by Matsusaka <TARGET_CIT> as the relative field of moduli ( or field of moduli over <MATH> ) , and it was defined to be the intersection of all fields of definition of <MATH> which contain <MATH> , in other words <MATH> .
o	The balanced ( fully - dimerized ) ground state properties can be found by introducing the density distribution function <MATH> for the dimer rapidities , and rewriting logaF2b into the integral equation <TARGET_CIT> <MATH> .
o	The authors also construct an action of <MATH> on the <MATH> -homology of Nakajima quiver varieties associated to <MATH> in <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Following Baez and Lauda <TARGET_CIT> we distinguish strict 2-groups ( where <MATH> and <MATH> ) , coherent 2-groups ( where the global quasiinverse <MATH> exists ) and weak 2-groups ( where there is not necessarily a global inverse )
o	In the <MATH> century , Vries <TARGET_CIT> , <TARGET_CIT> enumerated all cubic graphs until order <MATH> .
p	To overcome these limitations , various deep CNN - based face detection methods have been proposed in the literature <TARGET_CIT> , <TARGET_CIT> , <TARGET_CIT> , <TARGET_CIT> , <TARGET_CIT> . These methods have produced state - of - the - art results on many challenging publicly available face detection datasets .
o	In other dimensions one needs to slightly and straightforwardly generalize certain results of <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Birman <TARGET_CIT> shows that each closed orientable <MATH> -manifold <MATH> bounds a <MATH> -manifold <MATH> given by gluing two <MATH> -balls together along a Heegaard handlebody in their boundary <MATH> -spheres .
o	While no physical implementation is discussed in this paper , the abstract formalism relates to that of <TARGET_CIT> and could be implemented in a similar manner .
o	This generates a quadrupole - like field distribution , and the trapping takes place slightly below the zero field point , <MATH> , given by <TARGET_CIT> <MATH> .
o	Conder at al . 2006 <TARGET_CIT> listed a census of cubic semi - symmetric graphs until order 768 .
o	Connections have already been established between the different kinds of compact representations <TARGET_CIT> , which may facilitate extensions of ideas , frameworks , and results to those alternative models .
o	One of the main results of dinhSibony : <TARGET_CIT> , applied to the setting of compact Riemann surfaces , states that when <MATH> , there exist a polar set <MATH> and a regular Borel probability measure <MATH> such that <MATH> .
o	We define the pull - back homomorphism with support ( cf . <TARGET_CIT> )
o	The following result appeared in <TARGET_CIT> , and an essentially equal claim was also given earlier by <TARGET_CIT> .
o	More details can be found in <TARGET_CIT> .
o	The quantity gateaux is known as Gateaux differential of <MATH> in the direction of <MATH> ( see , e.g. , <TARGET_CIT> )
o	Although worthy and insightful , the treatments of <TARGET_CIT> and <TARGET_CIT> are both largely irrelevant for the analysis of analogue experiments .
o	Then it is proved in <TARGET_CIT> , following a general approach introduced in <TARGET_CIT> and based on a quantitative version of the subspace theorem , that this extra condition leads to transcendence measures . Indeed , taking all parameters into account , one could derive an upper bound of the type <MATH> .
p	An interesting result of <TARGET_CIT> is also that for some values of <MATH> , we have a reducible reduction ( of the form <MATH> ) for all <MATH> with <MATH> .
o	This connection has been used for the contact problem in Hild - Renard <TARGET_CIT> and Chouly - Hild <TARGET_CIT> , and for the obstacle problem in <TARGET_CIT> .
o	conductances(Line inductances <MATH> are neglected as we assume QSL approximations <TARGET_CIT> , which are reasonable in low - voltage mGs .

o	We will follow the common convention <TARGET_CIT> to redefine the reference point for energy measurements by subtracting the binding energy <MATH> , which diverges in the strongly attractive limit .
o	The Iyer - Wald - entropy <TARGET_CIT> formula in 3D is <MATH> .
o	By Lemma lem : unifconvinv and the uniform convergence of <MATH> and <MATH> to <MATH> and <MATH> respectively <TARGET_CIT> , it follows that these terms go to zero uniformly in <MATH> for each <MATH> .
o	In their paper , Shioda and Mitani shioda - <TARGET_CIT> showed that by taking the Kummer surface of a singular abelian surface , one is able to recover all singular K3 surfaces whose transcendental lattice has primitivity index which is divisible by 2 .
o	We therefore have <MATH> , in which <MATH> denotes the ensemble average with respect to the non - equilibrium density operator <MATH> <TARGET_CIT> .
o	The case of unitary operators and the one of compact normal operators are considered in <TARGET_CIT> and <TARGET_CIT> , respectively .
o	The Betti numbers <MATH> in <TARGET_CIT> are replaced by the Novikov - Betti numbers <MATH> or by <MATH> Betti numbers
o	Hence , the mass - loss rates would be 0.03 - 0.25 yr <MATH> and 0.007 - 0.07 yr <MATH> , which are too large to be produced by a normal steady stellar wind <TARGET_CIT> .
o	This is somewhat different than approaches based on <MATH> which contain <MATH> and <MATH> as commuting subgroups <TARGET_CIT> ; these approaches typically involve fields aside from the <MATH> connection possessing spacetime indices e.g. a co - tetrad in the fundamental representation of <MATH> Percacci:1984ai or a field which can dynamically tend to a Hodge dual operator on two - forms Lisi:2010td .
o	See Ehrgott 's historical overview <TARGET_CIT> , beginning with Edgeworth <TARGET_CIT> and Pareto <TARGET_CIT> .

o	The AC FD scenario is motivated by the recent FD implementations <TARGET_CIT> ; the notion of keeping the number of RF chains equal is also reasonable from a practical perspective , since RF chains are the components that dominantly increase the total cost of a radio <TARGET_CIT> .

o	In their concluding remarks from <TARGET_CIT> , Glebov , Kral , and Volec suggested an analogue of Theorem K4- in the context of <MATH> -uniform hypergraphs . Instead of looking at <MATH> they propose to look at the <MATH> -uniform hypergraph <MATH> on <MATH> vertices with <MATH> edges , so that a <MATH> -uniform hypergraph <MATH> contains <MATH> if and only if the link of some <MATH> -set of vertices contains a triangle . This is perfectly suited for the natural generalization of Example 1.3 to this context .
o	We define the slightly more general notion of occurrence of a pattern in another pattern , thus extending the definitions for unordered patterns <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Studies which impose periodic boundary conditions at the sides ( at <MATH> ) show the same qualitative behaviour in compression , but a " smaller is stiffer " behaviour for simple shear ( <TARGET_CIT> and <TARGET_CIT> )

o	The description above was used by Dickenstein and Tabera <TARGET_CIT> to study singular hypersurfaces .

o	These counterexamples build on a well - known counterexample of Bourgain from <TARGET_CIT> for a related but slightly different problem .
o	Such problems have been widely studied in the discrete time stochastic optimal control literature , see e.g. <TARGET_CIT> for references .
o	Since the proof in this case is inspired by a similar approach used in <TARGET_CIT> , we give the details at the end of the proof of <MATH> and <MATH> in Remark proofa .

o	The proof of <MATH> can be found in <TARGET_CIT> .

o	Recall that if <MATH> is an algebraic test configuration for a polarised manifold <MATH> that dominates <MATH> , then <MATH> for a unique <MATH> -Cartier divisor <MATH> supported on <MATH> , see <TARGET_CIT> .
o	This alternative exploration rate also appears in the non - asymptotic lower bound on the Gaussian Gittins index obtained by <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Read 1981 <TARGET_CIT> lists early developments for listing graphs .

o	As in the Poisson case , this notion only makes sense in the integrable case , but some recent ' stacky ' versions of Morita equivalence forgo the integrability hypothesis <TARGET_CIT> ( cf . also the weaker notion of Morita equivalence discussed in Ginzburg )
o	Recall that the latter condition is fulfilled if and only if <MATH> is densely generated by <MATH> ; see Lemma 4.4.5 of <TARGET_CIT> .
o	In higher dimensions , they were first examined by Kesten <TARGET_CIT> .
o	For Lipschitz domains , such a higher integrability result was proved in <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Randomization has been used in various settings such as voting and fair allocation of indivisible goods to achieve ex ante as well as procedural fairness <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Then a specific estimate , like the one returned by LASSO , is considered and an upper bound is derived assuming the design matrices satisfy certain conditions such as restrictive eigenvalue assumption <TARGET_CIT> , restricted isometry condition <TARGET_CIT> , or coherence conditions <TARGET_CIT> .

o	For some results of Monte Carlo simulations with positive temperatures and the moment of inertia constraint , see lim - <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Surprisingly , these spheres formed a kagome lattice <TARGET_CIT> rather than a typical hexagonal lattice because of the rotational entropy of the spheres <TARGET_CIT> .
o	The analogy between the classical Nakayama algebras and the higher Nakayama algebras is better appreciated in the context of Iyama 's higher Auslander - Reiten theory <TARGET_CIT> , which we review in Section subsec : higher_AR_theory .
o	The basic results in <TARGET_CIT> are analogous to those in <TARGET_CIT> with the set <MATH> replaced by <MATH> .
o	In fact , the map that sends , to every <MATH> , the image of the branch point by the developing map of the associated holomorphic deformation , is a local holomorphic diffeomorphism ( see <TARGET_CIT> )
o	Theorem 5.4 in <TARGET_CIT> states that the ED degree of a variety <MATH> agrees with the generic ED degree provided the conormal variety <MATH> is disjoint from the diagonal <MATH> in <MATH> .
o	This method was implemented in generic LRSM by the authors of <TARGET_CIT> . The implementation of this mechanism as a solution to the DW problem in LRSM typically puts an upper bound on the scale of gauge symmetry breaking .
o	One important family consists of the Hermite processes ( see , e.g. <TARGET_CIT> , for details )
p	As observed in <TARGET_CIT> , it is however possible to find functionals of the above form that ' approximate ' <MATH> in the sense that their asymptotic slopes coincide , up to an explicit correction term that vanishes precisely when the central fiber <MATH> is reduced . This is a key observation .
o	The other implication is the main part in Theorem zero and is based on the regularity method for hypergraphs and is the main result in RRS - <TARGET_CIT> .
o	We then consider the so - called special maximal rationally connected ( MRC ) fibration <MATH> of <MATH> in the sense of Nakayama <TARGET_CIT> , where the general fibres are rationally connected and the <MATH> -action on <MATH> descends to a biregular action of <MATH> on <MATH> .
o	The reason is that all certificates used by Ghasemi and Marshall are always SOS , while SONCs are not SOS in general ; see Iliman : deWolff : <TARGET_CIT> .
o	A detailed discussion can again be found in Appendix A of <TARGET_CIT> .
p	Approximate Personalized PageRank ( APPR ) algorithm , first introduced in the seminal paper <TARGET_CIT> , has been the cornerstone of local spectral graph clustering algorithms .
o	In addition , <TARGET_CIT> introduced user cooperation as a solution to the doubly near - far phenomenon that results in unfair rate allocation among users as observed in <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Note that if there exist solutions when <MATH> then the first three terms in ( cec4 ) become terms familiar from the Einstein - Cartan theory : Palatini , cosmological , and Holst terms respectively <TARGET_CIT> . The terms proportional to the coefficient <MATH> vanish in this limit and so represent new behaviour , whilst the final terms quadratic in curvature are boundary terms and do not contribute to the equations of motion . General - Relativistic limit grlimit By conducting small variations of ( cec4 ) one may straightforwardly obtain the equations of motion . Remarkably , solutions to these equations of motion exist for the
o	Just like the analysis of <TARGET_CIT> , the analysis of Bayes - UCB that we give in the next section relies on tight bounds on the tails of posterior distributions that permit to control quantiles .
o	In this paper we will prove analogous results for the minimal Lagrangian extension , whose existence was proved in <TARGET_CIT> as already remarked .
o	In Iliman : deWolff : <TARGET_CIT> the second and third author show the following theorem .
p	His result is the cornerstone of a wealth of further characterizations of complexity classes , cf . the monographs <TARGET_CIT> .
o	In order to do this , we proceed similarly to the proof of <TARGET_CIT> to show that this term is of order <MATH> in the worst case . <THEOREM> .
o	By the arguments used to prove LPRX , and in particular Lemma 4.4 in the same paper , with the slight modification pointed out above , we can find a point <MATH> , with <MATH> , and a unit vector <MATH> such that <MATH> . with <MATH> and <MATH> as in <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Unlike regular perturbation , however , a bounded solution <MATH> can still be obtained at resonance provided that the forcing terms satisfy a solvability condition <TARGET_CIT> , which corresponds to an equation for the zero - order waves on the slow scale .
n	Finally , recent approaches such as <TARGET_CIT> introduced spatially - dependent cluster membership probabilities through a regression model . These approaches use multilocus genotype data for the inference of spatial genetic structure , and therefore the absence of a coalescent framework limits inferences across the temporal dimension .
o	Then , we generalize the original block - wise BCC ensemble <TARGET_CIT> in order to obtain ensembles with larger coupling memories .
o	Typically this is done iteratively , with an N - body interaction being reduced to a 2-body interaction using a complete graph on <MATH> logical bits and <MATH> ancilla bits Perdomo - <TARGET_CIT> .
o	When the domain is infinite , the complexity of the CSP can be outside NP , and even undecidable <TARGET_CIT> .

o	The proof is a reduction from positive 1-in-3 - 3SAT ( one of the hard problems in Schaefer 's classification ; also see <TARGET_CIT> )
o	Observe moreover that <MATH> has a transition at <MATH> , which is reminiscent of the phase transition of the bilaplacian model on <MATH> ( see for instance <TARGET_CIT> )
o	The proofs are very akin to the original ones in <TARGET_CIT> .

o	An even more interesting and richer theory appears , when one adds geometry to the subject as in <TARGET_CIT> , or more combinatorics as in <TARGET_CIT> .
o	For the remainder of the proof , see <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Here , we give the definition of a spectral metric as introduced in <TARGET_CIT> ; we also define sequential Holder regularity of metrics .
o	By Lemma lem : recu backward pour dpp and <TARGET_CIT> applied to the pull - back measure of <MATH> <MATH> , we can find a Borel measurable map <MATH> such that <MATH> a^n,_2[Z^z,^(1)_1_r^(1)_2,M^z , m,^(1)_1_r^(1)_2]= a^n,_2[Z^z,^(1)_1_r^(1)_2,M^z , m,^(1)_1_r^(1)_2]_m- <MATH> We define <MATH> by <MATH> . for <MATH> . We then define recursively for <MATH> <MATH> . for <MATH> , in which <MATH> is a Borel measurable map such that
p	An immediate improvement in terms of <MATH> ( in fact suggested in the original manuscript ) was achieved by <TARGET_CIT> via conjugate gradient on a sub - sampled Hessian which reduces this to <MATH> .
o	By the infinitesimal lifting property of smoothness ( cf . <TARGET_CIT> ) , if there exists a first order deformation of <MATH> in <MATH> not liftable to a deformation over <MATH> for some <MATH> , then <MATH> is singular at <MATH> . We say <MATH> is unobstructed ( resp . obstructed ) in <MATH> if <MATH> is nonsingular ( resp . singular ) at <MATH> , and for an irreducible closed subset <MATH> of <MATH> , we say <MATH> is
o	By Lemma 2.1 , we can finish the proof , which is similar to that of Lemma 2.1 in <TARGET_CIT> , so it is omitted .
o	On the other hand , in recent years , there has been a lot of attention paid to the study of function spaces , especially Hardy spaces and BMO spaces , associated with various operators ; see , for example , <TARGET_CIT> .
o	At this point the rest of the argument follows exactly as in the proof of denittis - <TARGET_CIT> .
o	This problem has been analyzed and solved in denittis - <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Although it is possible to have sterile neutrino dark matter in LRSM , it is difficult to generate the correct relic abundance of a 7.1 keV sterile neutrino dark matter if the right handed gauge boson mass is kept around 3 TeV <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Recall that <MATH> is equal to the number <MATH> of non - backtracking paths , see page 115 in <TARGET_CIT> .
o	In principle , stereo methods using PatchMatch inference <TARGET_CIT> can not take advantage of the cost filtering acceleration , since in those methods the candidate disparity labels are given dynamically to each pixel and we can not make a consistent - label cost - volume slice <MATH> .
o	But we know that for any irreducible <MATH> , every representation that appears in <MATH> appears with multiplicity one ( this is a standard computation for the principal series case , and <TARGET_CIT> for the supersingular case )
o	In order to connect to the existence and uniqueness result in <TARGET_CIT> we need the following .

o	In <TARGET_CIT> it is proved that ALBA steps preserve validity of quasi - inequalities .
o	In the classical setting of submanifolds of <MATH> this is the same space as the space <MATH> considered by Beresnevich , Kleinbock and Margulis in beresnevich - kleinbock - <TARGET_CIT> .
o	For this , we developed a new mathematical approach , based on a generalization of the Bremmer series <TARGET_CIT> .

o	For this we invoke the classification theorem of unitary representations of pro - oligomorphic groups proved in <TARGET_CIT> .
o	In what follows , we explore the possibility of applying the methodology of <TARGET_CIT> to prove the missing canonicity result and discuss why it also fails .
o	Small seeds suppress crystallization , whereas large seeds promote it <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Baker , Dewdney et al . 1974 <TARGET_CIT> enumerated and showed that the number of simple graphs with order <MATH> is <MATH> .
o	Moreover , we show that it reduces to the old version of the FKMM - invariant described in denittis - <TARGET_CIT> , and so to the Fu - Kane - Mele indices in the case of spaces with a discrete number of fixed points .
o	For instance , if we consider the classical two - dimensional Kolmogorov flow <TARGET_CIT> represented on a <MATH> Fourier basis , then <MATH> ( <MATH> )
o	The idea of reducing the number of global communication points in Krylov subspace methods on parallel computer architectures was also used in the <MATH> -step methods by Chronopoulos et al . <TARGET_CIT> and more recently by Carson et al .

o	This statement was numerically verified for all <MATH> , <MATH> in <TARGET_CIT> .
n	In particular , unlike the formulation of <TARGET_CIT> , problem l1pg does not require any additional tuning parameters other than the ones used for APPR , nor does it introduce any constraints , such as non - negativity . More importantly , the formulation in GM14_ICML only implies the sparsity of the final solution as opposed to the intermediate iterates produced by any iterative procedure applied to solve the corresponding optimization problem .
n	In a single derivation , every differential kernel has a regular realization <TARGET_CIT> . However , this is no longer the case with more than one derivation , as evidenced by the system motivating above , which is also discussed in Example noprolon below .
o	Following <TARGET_CIT> , we will denote the closure <MATH> by <MATH> .
o	Yang and Ramanan <TARGET_CIT> proposed DAG - CNNs , which extract features from multiple layers to reason about high , mid and low - level features for image classification .
o	By ghm - <TARGET_CIT> , the Hausdorff dimension of the ancestor free times of <MATH> is a.s .
o	Therefore , using the Taylor approximation of <MATH> yields the achievability of the claimed protocol length ; we skip the details of this by - now - standard argument ( see , for instance , <TARGET_CIT> )
o	These bounds on RICs behave similarly to the ones obtained by Bah and Tanner in <TARGET_CIT> in Regime item : rho_0_delta_fixed , except that their constants are better .
o	In many cases we needed to do manual computations , when character tables were not available in the GAP Atlas of Group Representations <TARGET_CIT> and the GAP character table library <TARGET_CIT> .
o	We will also use that if <MATH> , then <MATH> by Sobolev embedding <TARGET_CIT> .

o	The following statement is the <MATH> -version of the result <TARGET_CIT> of N.A.Karpenko and A.S. Merkurjev for classical Chow groups ( see Remark 2.1 )
o	Building on <TARGET_CIT> , we introduce in Section Charts natural parametrisations of the leaves of Veech 's foliations that will be used in the sequel .
p	For instance , Lathauwer et al . proposed in <TARGET_CIT> a high - order singular value decomposition method to determine the components <MATH> and the core tensor <MATH> in a discrete setting . Such algorithm is simple , robust and it yields quasi - optimal low - rank approximations .
o	We begin by recalling the definition of the orbit category of a category with a free <MATH> -action , see for example page 1136 in <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Furthermore the principal part of the exponents <MATH> , called the oscillation index ( see arnold_gusein_varchenko : <TARGET_CIT> , Section 6.1.9 ) , can be computed in terms of Newton 's diagram of the Taylor expansion of the phase at its critical point ( see arnold_gusein_varchenko : <TARGET_CIT> , varchenko : <TARGET_CIT> )
o	It is possible to show that the DE recursion of SC - PCCs can be rewritten in the same form as <TARGET_CIT> and by using <TARGET_CIT> , threshold saturation can be proven .

o	Colloidal particles can be viewed as large atoms with tailorable size , shape and interactions <TARGET_CIT> .
o	As we use the MODWT filters , we must slightly correct the position of the wavelet coefficients to obtain the precise jump position ; see <TARGET_CIT> .
n	The weak non - planar condition of beresnevich - kleinbock - <TARGET_CIT> is not strong enough for example to show extremality in the applications to nilpotent groups described below .
n	However , as shown in Fig . Fig1 , these all - optical hybrid schemes <TARGET_CIT> using the best of matter - wave interferometry and quantum optomechanics seem , even in the most ambitious proposals requiring a space environment <TARGET_CIT> , to be limited to masses between <MATH> and <MATH> amu , putting them still away from the GQR .
o	Consider the representer polynomial <MATH> of <MATH> : <MATH> . where we note that <MATH> is a factor of <MATH> , which corresponds to two exponential vanishing moments <TARGET_CIT> .

o	We have studied this question in <TARGET_CIT> .
o	The Sage Mathematical Software <TARGET_CIT> was used at an early stage of this work to experiment with examples .
p	In practice , limited transmission range of sensors significantly impacts the wireless connectivity of a WSN , hence the disk model <TARGET_CIT> can be seen as a good candidate model for wireless connectivity among sensor nodes .
n	Their results follow from an interesting estimation of the moments of the fluctuations . While their estimation is interestingly of the right order ( namely <MATH> ) , the authors of <TARGET_CIT> did not pursue on giving an upper bound of the constant appearing in their rate function , see Claim <MATH> and <MATH> of Point <MATH> in <TARGET_CIT> . Unfortunately , the constant <MATH> appearing in the rate function is of crucial importance when deriving phase transitions , see Section sec : main for instance .

o	Due to the Borel isomorphism theorem <TARGET_CIT> , all countable standard Borel spaces are discrete and all uncountable ones are isomorphic to each other .
o	The proof of Lemma lem : minpartition in <TARGET_CIT> actually works with the restriction of Lemma lem : lubell concerning the topmost sets ( that there is no set of size bigger than <MATH> ) with <MATH> , immediately giving a new proof of Theorem thm : La2.25 .

o	The intermediate liquid has been observed in simulations of solid - solid transitions of hardsphere thin films <TARGET_CIT> and 2D ice <TARGET_CIT> , and may exist in other atomic systems because the liquid / solid surface tension is smaller than the solid / solid surface tension for most metals and alloys .

o	In particular , condition ( eq : conn_Pn2 ) is essential for real - world WSN implementations in order to ensure the resilience of the network against node capture attacks ; e.g. , see <TARGET_CIT> .
o	By direct examination of the table of newforms found at <TARGET_CIT> we see that the lowest value of <MATH> for which neither of the previous conditions is satisfied is <MATH> , as the associated space of cusp forms happens to be of dimension <MATH> , containing an oldclass generated by the newform on <MATH> .
o	The topological entropy of a meromorphic single - valued map is bounded from above by the logarithm of its largest dynamical degree ( Dinh and Sibony <TARGET_CIT> ) ; equality is conjectured .

o	The group structure on <MATH> , which makes <MATH> a group homomorphism , has been described in full detail in the proof of denittis - <TARGET_CIT> and is based on the splitting eq : stab_rank_Q_low_d>1 and on the additivity of the FKMM - invariant with respect to the Whitney sum ( property ( 4 ) in Section subsec : gen_FKMM_inv )
p	This has been studied thoroughly by Abramovich and Fantechi in <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Methodology There have been several methods proposed for estimation of the precision matrix in the high - dimensional setting when <MATH> ( see <TARGET_CIT> , <TARGET_CIT> )
o	Some of the techniques and motivations from this work were also generalized by the authors to provide faster rates for a large family of non - convex optimization problems <TARGET_CIT> .
p	In a ground - breaking confocal microscopy experiment , the first in situ observation of 3D crystallization was achieved at the single - particle level by using hard - sphere colloids , thereby allowing measurements of the nucleus structure , size distribution , nucleation rate and surface tension to be taken <TARGET_CIT> .
o	To construct a metaplectic <MATH> -fold cover of <MATH> of <MATH> , we follow <TARGET_CIT> Section 2.2 .
o	In older versions of this non - divergence result ( such as in kleinbock - lindenstrauss - <TARGET_CIT> ) the second assumption involved a lower bound of the form <MATH> .
o	Indeed , we know that <MATH> is locally constant with respect to <MATH> ( <TARGET_CIT> and <TARGET_CIT> ) , and with respect to the weight <MATH> when <MATH> ( Ber12 )

o	The main motivation for us was to understand the calculations of <TARGET_CIT> in a more categorical framework .
o	These combinatorial objects can be used to model networks of millimeter wave - connected 5 G base stations in ultra - dense urban deployment <TARGET_CIT> .
o	It shows up in <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Early works on the one - body and many - body theory include <TARGET_CIT> and <TARGET_CIT> , respectively , and we refer to these for further physical motivations .
o	We recall ( see e.g. <TARGET_CIT> for <TARGET_CIT> ) that objects in <MATH> correspond to cellular decompositions of a circle <MATH> .
p	In <TARGET_CIT> it was shown that Mosco convergence of <MATH> spaces is still the key point to obtain convergence results for solutions of Neumann problems for the Helmholtz equation . Moreover , for the Helmholtz equation , a quantitative version of the Rellich compactness property turns out to be essential .
o	Originally , this was done in <TARGET_CIT> and then formalized in <TARGET_CIT> .
o	In analogy to <TARGET_CIT> , this corollary can be translated into an explicit positive formula for the polar degrees and hence for the ED degree of <MATH> .

o	Later , Chou <TARGET_CIT> proved that the inclusion <MATH> is strict for any non - compact , locally compact , nilpotent group . On the other hand , he remarked that equality does hold for some non - compact , locally compact groups , and introduced the name Eberlein for this class .
o	Heavy Quark Effective Theory ( HQET ) <TARGET_CIT> may be considered the simplest particular case of NRQCD , in which the only low energy scale is <MATH> , the typical hadronic scale . The construction of HQET is formally very similar to the one of HDET , and it was a source of inspiration for the so called Large Energy Effective Theory ( LEET ) Dugan:1990de .
p	The first rigorous derivation of the Wulff construction for a genuine short - range model in three dimensions was achieved by Cerf in the context of bond percolation <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Let <MATH> be a gauge form on <MATH> , in <TARGET_CIT> , the authors constructed an integer - valued function <MATH> _ , ( ) <MATH> on <MATH> that takes the role of <MATH> before .
o	By <TARGET_CIT> <MATH> is also rigid .
o	As discussed in <TARGET_CIT> , most of the paradigmatic collapse models predict , at the level of density matrices , a PLD .
o	For algorithmic aspects we refer the interested reader e.g. to <TARGET_CIT> .
o	It follows that <MATH> is generally exponentially small , which is a common feature of low gradients or adiabatic limits <TARGET_CIT> .
o	In <TARGET_CIT> , Honda , Kazez and Matic also define the fractional Dehn twist coefficient ( FDTC )
o	While alternative divergences may be difficult to optimize , they may give better approximations <TARGET_CIT> .
o	In <TARGET_CIT> a model is proposed that combines word embedding with knowledge graph embedding .
o	The following is a special case of <TARGET_CIT> , but we provide a quick proof .
o	Following <TARGET_CIT> , we set <MATH> to the value that leads to the best autocorrelation function among those that visit all modes .
o	cor The dynamical degrees of <MATH> are algebraic integers <TARGET_CIT> .
o	In some instances , it is interesting to include in our functionals eq : Psi1 and eq : Psi2 a state - dependent running cost <MATH> and use constant marginal costs / rewards of control <MATH> ( see our example in Section or problems studied in <TARGET_CIT> , <TARGET_CIT> or <TARGET_CIT> )
o	Also , Ref . <TARGET_CIT> focused on the issue of age problem in the NADE model and determined the age of the universe in the NADE model by fitting the observational data .
p	We consider three variants of this baseline : pTransE <MATH> is the version proposed in <TARGET_CIT> , which uses anchor text for aligning word vectors and entity vectors ; pTransE <MATH> is the improvement proposed in DBLP : conf / emnlp / <TARGET_CIT> , which uses the words in the Wikipedia article <MATH> instead of anchor text ( and a slightly different model ) ; pTransE <MATH> is a variant of pTransE <MATH> , which uses the bag of words representation <MATH> instead , as in our method .
p	In this direction , the main result concerning algebraic numbers was obtained by Bugeaud and the first author <TARGET_CIT> who proved that <MATH> for all algebraic irrational numbers <MATH> and all integers <MATH> .
o	We prepared multi - view images ( i ) with the upright orientation assumption and ( ii ) without the upright orientation assumption using the rendering software published in <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Our analysis makes it easy to plug in other sketching and online PCA methods ( e.g. <TARGET_CIT> )
o	Two interesting spaces of singular surfaces Let <MATH> be the set of moduli of singular abelian surfaces , i.e. isomorphism classes of singular abelian surfaces ; in shioda - <TARGET_CIT> , Shioda and Mitani described <MATH> by means of the transcendental lattice <MATH> associated to any singular abelian surface <MATH> .
o	Unfortunately , such an approach breaks down in the case of a general Kahler class . In this paper , we circumvent this problem by a pluripotential approach , making use of a certain multivariate variant <MATH> of the Monge - Ampere energy functional , which turns out to play a role analogous to that of the Deligne pairing in arguments of the type <TARGET_CIT> .
o	In particular , <MATH> is generally not normal . Theorem thm : eins rests on work by Aluffi <TARGET_CIT> , Esterov <TARGET_CIT> , and Matsui - Takeuchi <TARGET_CIT> .
o	By a result of Ax - Roquette ( Corollary 11.2.5 in <TARGET_CIT> ) , any algebraic extension of a PAC field is again PAC .
o	The following definition is given in Jiang , <TARGET_CIT> .
o	If <MATH> , it then follows that <MATH> lies on the boundary of <MATH> , where <MATH> is an alcove ( i.e. a fundamental domain ) of the action of <MATH> on <MATH> , see <TARGET_CIT> .
o	A method to solve DV1 is based on a direct discretization of <MATH> <TARGET_CIT> .
o	For transcritical flows , this scattering ( in the smooth limit ) is the classical analog of the Hawking effect ( We refer the reader to the literature on the Hawking effect in water waves <TARGET_CIT> and in particular <TARGET_CIT> , where the role of the scalar product and the energy is discussed with care , see Appendix B. )
o	It is known ( Benjamini and Mossel <TARGET_CIT> , Mathieu and Remy <TARGET_CIT> , Rau <TARGET_CIT> , Berger , Biskup , Hoffman and Kozma <TARGET_CIT> and Pete <TARGET_CIT> ) that <MATH> as <MATH> , prompting the following conjecture of Benjamini .
o	The starting point for our work in this paper , was a twin result for the Hodge - Dirac operator <MATH> proved by the last two named authors jointly with Keith in <TARGET_CIT> . There it was proved , in the case of compact manifolds , that <MATH> .
o	In <TARGET_CIT> it is shown that a kind of Fractional Poisson process can be constructed by using an " inverse subordinator " , which leads to a further approach .
o	Using the properties of <MATH> established in Lemma lem : fakehessian , we can apply Proposition 14.2.1 in <TARGET_CIT> together with the arguments in <TARGET_CIT> ( mentioned in the proof of Proposition prop : Dfredholm ) and deduce that <MATH> is Fredholm .
o	In phase retrieval via lifting <TARGET_CIT> , and in covariance matrix estimation via sketching <TARGET_CIT> , the measurement matrices are symmetric ( or Hermitian ) rank-1 matrices .
o	In some implementations <TARGET_CIT> , these estimates are updated iteratively as more evaluations of <MATH> are obtained , which provides more accurate inference and tends to reduce the number of function evaluations required to find good solutions but increases the computational overhead per evaluation .
o	This paper is inspired by <TARGET_CIT> , in which the authors treat the case of the existence of freezing phase transitions and of the renormalization of potentials for a certain class of substitutions : <MATH> -full marked primitive aperiodic substitutions .
o	With these definitions , the linear minimum mean - square error ( LMMSE ) estimate of the channel of MT  <MATH>  at time  <MATH>  ( i.e. , during the data transmission phase ) can be written as <TARGET_CIT>  <MATH> .
o	In ( ykt ) , similar to the uplink ,  <MATH>  and  <MATH>  denote the downlink distortion noise <TARGET_CIT> at the BS and the  <MATH>  MT , respectively , where  <MATH> .
o	As we assume that the eavesdropper 's CSI is not available at the BS , AN is injected to degrade the eavesdropper 's ability to decode the data intended for the MTs <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Eq . ( yEt ) also implies that the thermal noise at the eavesdropper is negligibly small <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Furthermore , we assume that the eavesdropper has perfect CSI , i.e. , it can perfectly estimate the effective eavesdropper channel matrix  <MATH> , and can perfectly decode and cancel the interference caused by all MTs except for the MT of interest <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Hence , we adopt the ergodic secrecy rate achieved by a given MT as performance metric <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Before analyzing the secrecy rate , we first employ Lemma <TARGET_CIT> ] MRC to obtain a lower bound on the achievable rate for the multiple - input single - output ( MISO ) phase noise channel given by ( ykt )
o	The deviation from the average effective channel gain is treated as Gaussian noise having variance  <MATH> , cf . <TARGET_CIT> ;
o	Motivated by the coding scheme for the non - secrecy case in <TARGET_CIT> , a similar coding scheme that supports the secrecy rate given in ( rseck ) is described as follows .
o	Then , at each MT , the  <MATH>  received symbols across the multiple coherence intervals are jointly decoded <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Lemma 3 confirms that when the number of BS antennas is sufficiently large , i.e. ,  <MATH> , as long as  <MATH> , the impact of the multiuser interference from the  <MATH>  MT vanishes , as is commonly assumed in the massive MIMO literature , e.g. <TARGET_CIT> .
o	The last equality in ( exs ) is obtained by applying Theorem 1 in Appendix A <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Therefore , in this subsection , we first evaluate  <MATH>  for the conventional NS precoder , where  <MATH>  is designed to lie in the NS of the estimated channel vectors of all MTs ,  <MATH> ,  <MATH> , which is the most common design used in the literature <TARGET_CIT> .
o	For the conventional NS AN precoder , where  <MATH> <TARGET_CIT> , the AN leakage power received at MT  <MATH>  in time interval  <MATH>  is given by  <MATH> .
o	Optimizing the AN precoder for maximization of the secrecy rate <TARGET_CIT> is an interesting topic for future work .
o	In <TARGET_CIT> it was shown that if perfect hardware is employed , injection of AN is necessary to achieve secrecy .
o	Typical values for the phase noise increment standard deviations ,  <MATH> ,  <MATH> , used include  <MATH> , which was adopted in the long - term evolution ( LTE ) specifications <TARGET_CIT> , and  <MATH> , which corresponds to strong phase noise according to <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Furthermore , typical values for the additive distortion noise  <MATH>  include  <MATH> <TARGET_CIT> , whereas the amplified receiver noise was set to  <MATH> <TARGET_CIT> , with  <MATH> .
o	Theorem <TARGET_CIT> : If  <MATH>  are free from  <MATH> , then  <MATH>  <MATH> . where  <MATH> .
o	The ergodic secrecy rate achieved by the  <MATH>  MT in symbol interval  <MATH>  is given by Lemma <TARGET_CIT> ] zhu  <MATH> .
o	In ( sig1 ) ,  <MATH>  exploits that the channel estimate and the estimation error are uncorrelated <TARGET_CIT> , and  <MATH>  exploits the mutually independence of  <MATH> ,  <MATH> , and  <MATH> .
o	Semantic parsers map sentences onto logical forms that can be used to query databases <TARGET_CIT> , instruct robots <TARGET_CIT> , extract information <TARGET_CIT> , or describe visual scenes <TARGET_CIT> .
o	In this paper we consider the problem of semantically parsing questions into Freebase logical forms for the goal of question answering . Current systems accomplish this by learning task - specific grammars <TARGET_CIT> , strongly - typed CCG grammars <TARGET_CIT> , or neural networks without requiring any grammar <TARGET_CIT> .
p	Paraphrasing has shown to be promising for semantic parsing <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Earlier approaches to paraphrasing used phrase - based machine translation for text - based QA <TARGET_CIT> , or hand annotated grammars for KB - based QA <TARGET_CIT> .
o	While CFGs have been explored for paraphrasing using bilingual parallel corpus <TARGET_CIT> , ours is the first implementation of CFG that uses only monolingual data .
o	L - PCFGs have been used in various ways , most commonly for syntactic parsing
o	We start this section in subsec : background with a background on L - PCFGs and the Paralex corpus <TARGET_CIT> , a large scale question corpus , on which we train our model for paraphrase generation .
o	Word lattices , formally weighted finite state automata , have been used in previous works for paraphrase generation <TARGET_CIT> . We use an unweighted variant of word lattices in our algorithm .
o	In this setting , we use the PPDB <TARGET_CIT> to build word lattices .
o	For our experiments , we extract rules from the PPDB - Small to maintain the high precision <TARGET_CIT> .
o	We experiment with three ways of constructing word lattices : naive word lattices representing the words from the input question only , word lattices constructed with the Paraphrase Database <TARGET_CIT> and word lattices constructed with a bi - layered L - PCFG , described in subsec : hybrid .
o	For our experiments , we extract rules from the PPDB - Small to maintain the high precision <TARGET_CIT> .
o	L - PCFG Estimation We train the L - PCFG  <MATH>  on the Paralex corpus <TARGET_CIT> .
o	We construct a treebank by parsing 2.4 M distinct questions from Paralex using the BLLIP parser <TARGET_CIT> - <TARGET_CIT> .
o	This step is similar to lexical pruning in standard grammar - based generation process to avoid an intermediate derivation which can never lead to a successful derivation <TARGET_CIT> .
o	These two criteria are important for the problem of paraphrase generation in open - domain question answering as we want our model to capture paraphrase information for any given question and to generate paraphrases efficiently without falling into the NP - completeness of natural language generation <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Our generation algorithm differs from existing literature <TARGET_CIT> on the usage of word lattices to generate paraphrases . Existing systems often use alternative paths between two nodes in word lattices to generate paraphrases . In contrast , we sample words from a path in the word lattice using a grammar regardless of their order in the path .
o	First , the sampling from an L - PCFG grammar lessens the lexical ambiguity problem evident in lexicalized grammars such as tree adjoining grammars <TARGET_CIT> and combinatory categorial grammars <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Our grammar is not lexicalized , only unary context - free rules are lexicalized . Second , the top - down sampling restricts the combinatorics inherent to bottom - up search <TARGET_CIT> .
o	The lack of order information in the input often raises the high combinatorics in lexicalist approaches <TARGET_CIT> .
o	And fourth , we impose no constraints on the grammar thereby making it easier to maintain bi - directional ( recursive ) grammars that can be used both for parsing and for generation <TARGET_CIT> .
n	Existing systems often use the multi - sequence alignment technique <TARGET_CIT> or a syntax - based alignment approach <TARGET_CIT> over multiple English translations of the same source text to produce word lattices . However , these lattices only capture paraphrase patterns locally from the translation set and generate new sentences for this set of sentences .
o	We use WEKA <TARGET_CIT> to replicate the classifier of madnani2012 with our new feature .
o	We use <TARGET_CIT> to convert paraphrases to ungrounded graphs .
o	This conversion involves three steps : 1 ) parsing the paraphrase using a CCG parser to extract syntactic derivations <TARGET_CIT> , 2 ) extracting logical forms from the CCG derivations <TARGET_CIT> , and 3 ) converting the logical forms to an ungrounded graph.(Please see <TARGET_CIT> for more details .
o	The model parameters are estimated with the averaged structured perceptron <TARGET_CIT> .
o	We evaluate our approach on the dataset <TARGET_CIT> . consists of 5,810 question - answer pairs where questions represents real Google search queries . We use the standard train / test splits , with 3,778 train and 2,032 test questions . We compare our paraphrasing models with monolingual machine translation based model for paraphrase generation <TARGET_CIT> . 
o	We use the Stanford CoreNLP caseless tagger for part - of - speech tagging <TARGET_CIT> .
p	For the classical matrix groups SO <MATH>  and U <MATH>  the invariant measure was determined by Hurwitz <TARGET_CIT> in a pioneering paper written in the late 1890 's .
o	The recent work <TARGET_CIT> documents the importance of this paper as seen from subsequent developments in random matrix theory .
o	One place where Hurwitz 's idea of an invariant measure on matrix spaces is pivotal , but which appears to be little known in the random matrix theory community , is in Siegel 's work <TARGET_CIT> on the geometry of numbers .
o	In Si45 Siegel took up the problem of defining an invariant measure on the space of random unimodular lattices , being guided by both <TARGET_CIT> and , according to <TARGET_CIT> , the work of Minkowski <TARGET_CIT> on the theory of quadratic forms .
o	The first step in <TARGET_CIT> is to define an invariant measure on the matrix group  <MATH>  of all  <MATH>  real matrices with unit determinant . Unlike SO <MATH>  and U <MATH> , this set is not compact , and in particular does not have a finite volume .
o	In developing the work of Siegel , Macbeath and Rogers <TARGET_CIT> introduced a truncation of  <MATH> , defined by requiring that the operator norm  <MATH> , where  <MATH>  is the largest singular value of  <MATH> , be bounded by some value  <MATH> .
o	Later Duke , Rudnick and Sarnak <TARGET_CIT> considered a similar truncation , now requiring that the 2-norm  <MATH> , where  <MATH>  is the  <MATH> -th largest singular value , be bounded .
o	In S2.1 and S2.2 we show that the problem of computing the volume of these sets , discussed in <TARGET_CIT> and <TARGET_CIT> using methods which have not been followed up in subsequent literature can , alternatively , be approached using integration methods for matrix integrals in common use in random matrix theory and involving the Selberg integral Se44 .
o	Next , in S2.3 , we consider the problem of computing the asymptotic volume of these and similar truncated sets in the  <MATH>  limit . Actually , there are already a number of such computations in the literature <TARGET_CIT> .
o	As pointed out by Duke , Rudnick and Sarnak <TARGET_CIT> these have an arithmetic/ combinatorial significance .
o	Then we have from <TARGET_CIT> ( see also GM03 ) that  <MATH> where  <MATH>  is the Haar measure on  <MATH> , and  <MATH>  the volume of a fundamental domain , which has the known explicit evaluation in terms of the Riemann zeta function ( see e.g. MR58 )  <MATH> .
o	Knowledge of the asymptotic form of the RHS of ( Sa ) in the case of  <MATH>  then gives an asymptotic counting formula distinct from that already noted in <TARGET_CIT> for  <MATH> .
o	One is that of sampling matrices with invariant measure from the truncated sets , and sampling too the intersection of these sets with the fundamental domain <TARGET_CIT> . From the latter one can obtain estimates ( and analytic formulas for  <MATH> ) of the distribution of the corresponding bases vectors of the random lattice .
o	For  <MATH>  and fixed , one has ( see e.g. <TARGET_CIT> )  <MATH> .
o	As mentioned in the Introduction , such invariant measures were introduced by Hurwitz <TARGET_CIT> for the classical matrix groups SO <MATH>  and U <MATH> .
o	<MATH>  Hurwitz <TARGET_CIT> used parameterisations of SO <MATH>  and U <MATH>  in terms of Euler angles to obtain explicit formulas for the invariant measure and from this computed the associated volumes of these classical group .
o	As remarked in <TARGET_CIT> , in the context of selecting elements uniformly at random form SL <MATH> , this is the case  <MATH>  is analogous to bounding the condition number  <MATH> .
o	To compute the volume , as done in <TARGET_CIT> in relation to computing a similar volume in the case of SL <MATH>  ( see the next subsection ) , we make use of the singular value decomposition  <MATH> .
o	The explicit computation of the Jacobian for the change of variables from the elements of  <MATH>  to variables representing the independent elements on the RHS of ( MR ) was carried out in <TARGET_CIT> , and with  <MATH>  one has  <MATH> .
o	Here  <MATH>  and  <MATH>  are the invariant measures on O <MATH>  as identified by Hurwitz <TARGET_CIT> .
o	The value of  <MATH>  was calculated by Hurwitz <TARGET_CIT> ( see e.g. Mu82 and Remark R2.3 below ) ,  <MATH> .
o	the latter is the case  <MATH> ,  <MATH>  of the Selberg integral , using the notation of <TARGET_CIT> )
o	The  <MATH>  asymptotics of a class of averages including ( MR4 ) have been studied in <TARGET_CIT> , and from the results therein we read off ( MR4o ) and ( MR4e )
o	In <TARGET_CIT> Siegel considered the associated cone  <MATH> .
o	Doing this allows us to reduce the multidimensional integral down to a one - dimensional integral , as first shown by Jack and Macbeath <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Here use has been made of the notation for the Selberg integral as defined in <TARGET_CIT> , and its gamma function evaluation <TARGET_CIT> , as well as the notation  <MATH> .
o	This is in agreement with <TARGET_CIT> where this same functional form was deduced , but without the leading coefficient being evaluated .
o	The multidimensional integral in ( J6 ) is known <TARGET_CIT> , <TARGET_CIT> to be closely related to the Selberg integral , and has the gamma function evaluation ( see also Remark R27 below )  <MATH> .
o	<MATH>  An equivalent result , using different methods , has been given in <TARGET_CIT> .
o	The formula ( Sa ) of Duke , Rudnick and Sarnak <TARGET_CIT> , combined with Corollaries C2.5 and C2.9 , gives an asymptotic counting formula for matrices in SL <MATH> , as made explicit in <TARGET_CIT> for  <MATH> .
o	If true , the result of Jack <TARGET_CIT> would give that the leading large  <MATH>  form is proportional to  <MATH> , which for  <MATH>  is distinct from the  <MATH>  dependence in ( 6 )
o	<MATH> According to <TARGET_CIT> this average is given in terms of the  <MATH>  function as being equal to  <MATH> (
o	It is well known in random matrix theory that the zeros of the characteristic polynomial are closely related to the spectral density , in the sense that for a broad range of circumstances it can be proved that both share the same density function for large  <MATH> <TARGET_CIT> , although no such theorem is known in the present setting .
o	According to a realisation of the Dirichlet distribution ( see e.g. <TARGET_CIT> ) this construction implies the  <MATH> 's are uniformly distributed on  <MATH>  subject to the constraint  <MATH> .
o	Following <TARGET_CIT> , the qualities one is seeking is to choose a basis made of reasonably short vectors which are almost orthogonal .
o	By using our ability to sample the latter ( when restricted to have bounded norm ) we will show in the cases  <MATH>  these distributions can be approximated by combining the sampling with a lattice reduction algorithm <TARGET_CIT> .
o	It is well known in random matrix theory <TARGET_CIT> that the volume element for the change of variables from the elements of  <MATH>  to  <MATH>  and  <MATH>  is  <MATH> .
o	where  <MATH>  is the invariant measure on SO <MATH>  as identified by Hurwitz <TARGET_CIT> .
o	For each matrix  <MATH>  so generated , the Lagrange - Gauss algorithm ( see e.g. <TARGET_CIT> ) is applied so as to reduce , using elements of  <MATH> , the column vectors of  <MATH>  down to the fundamental domain .
o	It is known ( see e.g. <TARGET_CIT> ) that the total number of steps required is bounded by a constant times the square of the logarithm of the longest length vector in  <MATH> .
o	It was proved by Minkowski himself that in fact a finite number of equalities suffice , the explicit form of which can be found in <TARGET_CIT> for example .
o	The task of transforming the columns of  <MATH>  in the case  <MATH>  to a Minkowski reduced basis can be carried out using an algorithm due to Semaev <TARGET_CIT> .
o	It is proved in <TARGET_CIT> that the total number of steps required is bounded by a constant times  <MATH> , where  <MATH>  denotes the shortest vector in the reduced basis .
o	We remark that the invariant measure on the space of unimodular lattices for  <MATH>  plays a fundamental role in the studies <TARGET_CIT> relating to the periodic Lorenz gas .
o	The  <MATH>  limit The  <MATH>  lattice reduction algorithm of Semaev <TARGET_CIT> has been described in <TARGET_CIT> as a greedy version of two - dimensional Lagrange - Gauss lattice reduction - it used reduced vectors in dimension  <MATH>  to obtain the reduced basis in dimension  <MATH> .
o	However only for  <MATH>  does the greedy algorithm produce a Minkowski reduced basis <TARGET_CIT> .
o	On the other hand , it is in the limit  <MATH>  that an analytic description of the distribution of the shortest lattice vectors and their pairwise angles again becomes possible for lattices corresponding to Haar distributed SL <MATH>  matrices <TARGET_CIT> .
o	A result of <TARGET_CIT> , as generalised in <TARGET_CIT> , gives that with  <MATH>  fixed and  <MATH> , the sequence  <MATH>  is distributed as a Poisson process on  <MATH>  with intensity  <MATH> .
o	And with  <MATH> ,  <MATH> , denoting the angle between the pairs of vectors with length  <MATH>  and  <MATH> , it is proved in <TARGET_CIT> that each  <MATH>  has the distribution of the absolute value of a standard Gaussian random variable .
o	Generally the  <MATH>  limit of random lattices corresponding to Haar distributed SL <MATH>  matrices is of interest from a number of different perspective in mathematical physics ; see e.g. <TARGET_CIT> .
o	For this special case , it is known that source - channel separation is in general suboptimal <TARGET_CIT> and hybrid digital - analog coding schemes can outperform pure digital / analog schemes <TARGET_CIT> .
o	The extension of the hybrid coding architecture to the non - Gaussian setting can be found in <TARGET_CIT> .
o	This necessary condition , when specialized to the case of sending a scalar Gaussian source over a Gaussian broadcast channel , recovers the corresponding result by Reznic et al . <TARGET_CIT> ; moreover , in this way , the converse argument in <TARGET_CIT> finds a simple interpretation , and the associated auxiliary random variable acquires an operational meaning .
o	Therefore , the restriction imposed in the existing arguments <TARGET_CIT> is in fact unnecessary .
p	It will be seen that the analytical solutions for this problem can be found in some special cases ; interestingly , these solutions indicate that the specific choices of auxiliary random variables in <TARGET_CIT> are actually optimal in their respective contexts .
o	Our work is also partly motivated by the problem of sending a bivariate Gaussian source over a Gaussian broadcast channel first studied by Bross et al . <TARGET_CIT> .
o	For this problem , it is known that the achievable distortion region of a certain hybrid digital - analog coding scheme <TARGET_CIT> matches the outer bound in <TARGET_CIT> whereas separate source - channel coding is in general suboptimal <TARGET_CIT> .
o	An alternative proof of the outer bound in <TARGET_CIT> was recently obtained by Song et al . <TARGET_CIT> .
o	This new proof <TARGET_CIT> bears some similarity to the aforementioned converse argument by Reznic et al . <TARGET_CIT> .
o	We will clarify their connection by giving a unified proof for the vector Gaussian case , which implies , among other things , that the outer bound in <TARGET_CIT> can be deduced from the general necessary condition for the source broadcast problem found in the present paper .

o	It is known <TARGET_CIT> that  <MATH>  is given by the set of  <MATH>  satisfying  <MATH> .
o	For broadcast channel  <MATH> , we say that  <MATH>  is essentially less noisy than  <MATH>  if there exists a sufficient class of distributions  <MATH>  such that  <MATH>  for any  <MATH>  with  <MATH> <TARGET_CIT> , and simply say that  <MATH>  is less noisy than  <MATH>  if  <MATH>  can be chosen to be the set of all distributions on  <MATH> ;
o	similarly , we say that  <MATH>  is essentially more capable than  <MATH>  if there exists a sufficient class of distributions  <MATH>  such that  <MATH>  for any  <MATH>  with  <MATH> <TARGET_CIT> , and simply say that  <MATH>  is more capable than  <MATH>  if  <MATH>  can be chosen to be the set of all distributions on  <MATH> .
o	Note that the rate region defined by ( eq : nr1 ) and ( eq : nr2 ) for  <MATH>  with  <MATH>  is exactly  <MATH> <TARGET_CIT> .
o	One can obtain the following explicit characterization of  <MATH> <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Part 2 ) follows from Proposition prop : lessnoisy and the fact that  <MATH>  is essentially less noisy than  <MATH>  when  <MATH> <TARGET_CIT> .
o	According to <TARGET_CIT> ,  <MATH>  is more capable than  <MATH>  when  <MATH> .
o	Part 1 ) follows from Proposition prop : lessnoisy and the fact that  <MATH>  is less noisy than  <MATH>  when  <MATH> <TARGET_CIT> .
o	For Part 2 ) , one can readily show that  <MATH>  is given by the set of  <MATH>  satisfying  <MATH> . for some  <MATH>  by following the proof of <TARGET_CIT> .
o	In light of <TARGET_CIT> , when  <MATH>  and  <MATH> , the following optimization problem  <MATH> . has a unique maximizer at  <MATH> .
o	Indeed , for  <MATH> , it is known <TARGET_CIT> that  <MATH>  is more capable ( but not less noisy ) than  <MATH>  when  <MATH> ,
o	For example , according to <TARGET_CIT> ,  <MATH>  is essentially less noisy than  <MATH>  when  <MATH>  and  <MATH> ,
o	This result can be viewed as an extension of <TARGET_CIT> from degraded broadcast channels to general broadcast channels .
o	By the functional representation lemma <TARGET_CIT> ( see also <TARGET_CIT> ) , we can find a random variable  <MATH>  of cardinality  <MATH>  with the following properties :
o	see <TARGET_CIT> for the definition of typical sequences and the related properties )
o	Moreover ,  <MATH> . where ( eq : csiszar ) follows by the Csiszar sum identity <TARGET_CIT> .
o	One can show via a standard application of the support lemma <TARGET_CIT> that , in contrast with the cardinality bound  <MATH>  for preserving  <MATH> ,  <MATH> , it suffices to have  <MATH>  for the purpose of realizing all their extreme points .
o	We have  <MATH> . where ( eq : sameentropy ) follows since  <MATH> , ( eq : cyclic ) follows from <TARGET_CIT> , and ( eq : monotonicity ) is due to the fact that  <MATH>  is a monotonically decreasing function of  <MATH>  for  <MATH> .
o	It follows by the convexity of  <MATH>  in  <MATH> <TARGET_CIT> that  <MATH> . . Therefore , we must have  <MATH> , which together with ( eq : contain2 ) , proves ( eq : equal2 ) . The proof of Proposition lem : R12 indicates that , for the binary uniform source with the Hamming distortion measure , there is no loss of optimality ( as far as Theorem thm : remote is concerned ) in restricting  <MATH>  to be a binary symmetric channel , which provides a certain justification for the choice of the auxiliary random variable in <TARGET_CIT> .
o	A channel  <MATH>  with  <MATH>  for some integer  <MATH>  is said to be circularly symmetric <TARGET_CIT> ( see also <TARGET_CIT> ) if there exists a bijective function  <MATH>  such that  <MATH>  and  <MATH>  for all  <MATH> , where  <MATH>  denotes the  <MATH> -times self - composition of  <MATH>  ( with  <MATH>  being the identity function )
o	In light of <TARGET_CIT> , the uniform distribution on  <MATH>  forms a sufficient class of distributions for broadcast channel  <MATH>  if both  <MATH>  and  <MATH>  are circularly symmetric .
o	Therefore , we have  <MATH> . from which one can readily recover <TARGET_CIT> by invoking Theorem thm : binary .
o	In light of <TARGET_CIT> , for the optimization problem in ( eq : hatkappa ) , the maximum value is not attained at  <MATH>  or  <MATH>  if and only if  <MATH> .
o	It follows from <TARGET_CIT> that  <MATH>  is a convex set .
o	For any  <MATH> ,  <MATH> . where ( eq : lvextr ) is due to the conditional version of <TARGET_CIT> .
o	This provides a certain justification for the choice of the auxiliary random variable in <TARGET_CIT> .
o	For the case where  <MATH> ,  <MATH> , for some  <MATH>  and  <MATH>  satisfying  <MATH> , we can simplify ( eq : generalGaussian ) to  <MATH> . from which one can readily recover <TARGET_CIT> by setting  <MATH> .
o	This potentially weakened lower bound , when specialized to the case  <MATH> , is at least as tight as <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Setting  <MATH>  in ( eq : tight ) recovers <TARGET_CIT> .
o	An equivalent form of the lower bound in ( eq : tight ) was first obtained by Bross et al . <TARGET_CIT> via a different approach for the special case  <MATH> .
o	It is worth mentioning that source - channel separation is known to be suboptimal in general for this problem <TARGET_CIT> .
o	Somewhat surprisingly , the lower bound in ( eq : tight ) , derived with the aid of a source - channel separation theorem ( i.e. , Theorem thm : Gsep ) , turns out to be tight when  <MATH> <TARGET_CIT> and is achievable by a class of hybrid digital - analog coding schemes ( The hybrid scheme in TDS11 can be viewed as an extremal case of this class of schemes . ) <TARGET_CIT> .
o	The hybrid scheme in <TARGET_CIT> can be viewed as an extremal case of this class of schemes .
o	In the case of two variables the problem was solved by Hoeffding and Shrikhande <TARGET_CIT> who showed that  <MATH> m_2(x)= cases 2x - x^2 & forx < 2/5 ;
o	In 1966 Samuels <TARGET_CIT> formulated a conjecture on the least upper bound for the tail probability in terms of  <MATH> , which are not necessarily equal .
o	For simplicity , we state this conjecture in the case when means are equal . conjecture[Samuels <TARGET_CIT>
o	In <TARGET_CIT> it was shown rigorously that the minimum is attained by  <MATH>  for  <MATH> .
o	Samuels <TARGET_CIT> confirmed eq : Samuels for  <MATH> .
o	Moreover , Samuels <TARGET_CIT> proved that for  <MATH>  <MATH> .
o	In <TARGET_CIT> stated the following .
